I am going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation. I\u2019m going to fight for every child living in poverty. I\u2019m going to fight for every mom who lost their child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence. I\u2019m going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of our states like Ohio and Pennsylvania and Florida and so many others. You take a look at New England. You take a look at what\u2019s happened. You take a look at New York state, upstate New York, and you see what\u2019s going on. We will never ever ever let that happen again. We\u2019re going to bring them back. I\u2019m going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and the special interests. And I\u2019m going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one American flag. In 10 years, in 20 years, in 30 years, you\u2019re going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. We\u2019ve had a good time. But important things are happening. You\u2019re going to remember this day \u2013 this is a movement like nobody has seen in this country before.

Hillary\u2019s plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores. Just last week, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department plead guilty to joining ISIS. There are many of them. So let me state this as clearly as I can: If I\u2019m elected president of the United States, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. We\u2019ve got enough problems, don\u2019t you think? Don\u2019t you think we have enough? That\u2019ll end up being the great Trojan horse that they\u2019ll read about it in 200 years like you read about Trojan horse current. That will be and we don\u2019t want to be a part of that history. We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build the wall. We need it. And Mexico will pay for the wall. We got the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a candidate for president. Every year countless American lives are lost to sanctuary cities. My opponent strongly supports sanctuary cities. I don\u2019t think she knows why. Like the ones they got Kate Steinle killed by a five-time deported criminal illegal immigrant. If I\u2019m elected president, I\u2019m going to cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities and quickly. And we are going to make sure that our immigration authorities do the job that they\u2019re supposed to be doing. And these, in many cases, are great people that are not allowed to do the job. I can tell you in the case of the border patrol and the ICE agents, these are great American people that frankly, by backing me, they\u2019re going to working much harder. They don\u2019t have to stand back. You know the expression? It\u2019s called stand back. People just walk right into our country. We are going to save American lives. Either we win this election or we are going to lose this country. To sum up, here is some of the amazing things we\u2019re going to be doing for our country starting in 2017. We are going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan. We will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, which affects so many. We will defend our religious liberty. We will provide school choice to every low-income child in America. And we are going to end Common Core. Education is going to be brought locally. We will totally support the men and women of law enforcement. We talked about this last night at the debate. We will save the Second Amendment, which right now is under siege. And I will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.

We are going to stop them. It won\u2019t be hard. Won\u2019t be hard. In order to help bring our jobs back to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, all across this great nation, I\u2019m going to undertake a major reorganization of our bureaucracy, which we have to do. Have to do. American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the departments of agriculture, commerce, labor, state, treasury. All of these departments, so many departments. Get that mosquito out of here. Get a little nervous with mosquitoes nowadays, folks. But up here, you haven\u2019t been hit yet, right? That\u2019s what we need is a nice mosquito bite. Thank you. I love you, too. Mosquito bite right smack in the middle of the nose. No, we don\u2019t want it. In my administration, all trade policy making will be consolidated into one very important office. We\u2019re going to call it the American Desk, and it will be located inside the Department of Commerce. And I\u2019ll be checking with those people because we\u2019re not going to lose our companies anymore. It\u2019s so complicated. So many different departments have to get involved, and by the time they get involved, they\u2019re gone, they signed with all of these other countries. The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker and the national interests of the United States because they are hurting our national interest. We owe $20 trillion right now, doubled under Obama, and we haven\u2019t done anything. Our roads are bad. Our airports are bad. Our schools are bad. Everything is bad. They\u2019re falling down. So we have all this debt. We haven\u2019t started yet because we have to fix the infrastructure of our country. It\u2019s going to be America first, believe me. As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35% to 15%. We\u2019re also going to rebuild our inner cities. African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable and unbelievable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There\u2019s no education. There are no jobs. And there\u2019s practically no safety. Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, since Jan. 1st, 3,500 people. That\u2019s worse than what you are reading about over in the Middle East in many cases. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. And it\u2019s getting worse. To the African-American and Hispanic communities who are suffering, I say what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I\u2019m going to fix the inner cities. I\u2019m going to fix the inner cities. What do you have to lose? Seriously and I mean it. The inner cities are so bad. They\u2019ve been run so badly by Democrats for decades and decades and decades, sometimes more than an hundred years unbroken. And they get the votes and they go on their way and they don\u2019t do a thing. So I hope the African-Americans, I hope the Hispanics; I hope they\u2019re going to vote. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country, and national security begins at the border. Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally open trade and open borders. You saw that last night when she tried to lie about it, right? She tried to lie about it, and she came up with something, she was talking about energy. She tried to lie about it just like she lied about other things. She tried to lie last night.

But this is why I\u2019m proposing a package of ethic reforms to make up a government honest once again. It\u2019s time to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington D.C. and we\u2019re going to do it. Those reforms include the following: A five-year ban on executive branch in congressional officials lobbying the government after they leave government service. They\u2019re making a fortune. Not going to happen. That\u2019s why they make all these sweetheart deals. A lifetime ban on former executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. A ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. I don\u2019t want that. You don\u2019t want that. Nobody wants that. And you wonder why we make all of these dumb deals, those horrible deals. Friends of mine come up \u201cHow could have they made such a stupid deal. They can\u2019t be that\u201d and I said \u201cThey are actually smart. But you have to understand, this is the way the system works.\u201d Additionally, I\u2019m going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. It\u2019s about time. Not only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation. My plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. At the center of what will be a historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals and they are terrible. 47 million Americans are in poverty, and 45 million Americans are right now on food stamps. We have nearly $800 billion annual trade deficits in goods with the world. And the worst so-called recovery, since the Great Depression. And you know, we hear about a recovery. It\u2019s the worst since the Great Depression. Hard to believe. Ohio has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization. Two deals done by Bill and backed strongly by crooked Hillary. America has lost \u2013 listen to this \u2013 70,000 factories since China joined the WTO. And by the way, try doing business over in China. Not that easy, folks. Not easy. We\u2019re living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. They\u2019re stealing our jobs. They\u2019re stealing our companies. They\u2019re taking our money. We have drugs. We have debt. We have empty factories. That\u2019s going to end. That\u2019s going to end. So easy.

And we\u2019re going to change that very fast. Our vets are going to be treated properly and with great respect. That\u2019s not happening now. And we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Just in case you haven\u2019t noticed, rates are going up 60%, 70%, 80%. Next year is going to be worse. It\u2019s a catastrophe and it\u2019s dying anyway but we are going to repeal it, replace it. You\u2019re going to have great health care at a fraction of the cost, okay? Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration. Your jobs have fled. Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump administration. And Hillary Clinton is going to raise your taxes. She\u2019s going to raise your taxes. Your companies won\u2019t be leaving Ohio under a Trump administration. Right now our economy isn\u2019t growing practically at all. Last Quarter it was only around 1% GDP. People have hardly ever heard of numbers like that. If in China it goes to 7% or 8%, it\u2019s like considered a national catastrophe. Here, we\u2019re at 1%; isn\u2019t everything wonderful? Everything is not wonderful. And if it was wonderful, we wouldn\u2019t have packed auditoriums no matter where we go. Believe me.

She was given, think of it \u2013 she was given these questions. She used these questions, studied the questions, got the perfect answer for the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally wrong and inappropriate. Hence the name, Crooked Hillary. Years ago there was a show called \u201cThe $64,000 Question\u201d. A contestant got the questions in advance, and his life was ruined. They found out about it, remember? Anybody remember his name? Come on\u2026 Van Doren, very good! You look younger than that. Charles Van Doren. Charles Van Doren was his name. He got the questions, and his life was ruined. But Hillary\u2026 Hillary Clinton got the ques\u2026 Think of it. Forget Donna Brazile. She should resign. She looked like such a fool last night on television trying to say \u201cWell\u201d\u2026 She didn\u2019t know what was going on. She had no idea.

Can you imagine if I got the questions? They would call for the re-establishment of the electric chair. Do you agree with it? Right? She got the questions, and she didn\u2019t report it. She went out there knowing the questions. She didn\u2019t report it. That is very dishonest. She\u2019s a very dishonest person. This is even bigger because we are going for the presidency of the United States. So, this is very important. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt and dishonest person ever to seek the office of the presidency. So, it\u2019s in that context that I was asked a question about whether I would agree in advance to concede the results on election night if for some reason we should lose, which we\u2019re not going to lose. And that was sort of unprecedented question. If Al Gore or George Bush had agreed three weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case, and no Bore\u2026 Gore versus Bush or Bush versus Gore. And there have been numerous other cases. In effect, I\u2019m being asked to wave centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters. But listen to this. According to Pew, highly respected, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate. Okay, I think the people in this room understand it more than our leaders. Although, maybe our leaders understand more than we think they understand. Listen to this: 1.8 million people are dead, but they\u2019re registered to vote. Some of whom vote even though they\u2019re dead, which is really a hard thing to do but it\u2019s easy if fraud is involved. Right? See 1.8 million people who are dead who are registered to vote and some of them vote. One was a Republican and after death became a Democrat. It\u2019s true. 2.8 million people are registered in more than one state. So, you got 2.8 million people, they can vote in Ohio and someplace else. And 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote. And then I hear we have such a beautiful \u2013 everything\u2019s so wonderful\u2026 You understand where I\u2019m coming from, I think, right? Now I am not a politician. So, I can say it like it is.

We are going to do something that has never been done before in this country, believe me. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election \u2013 if I win. All right. Seriously, the debate last night was amazing, and everybody said I won, including every single online poll and some had it at 90% and close to 90%. So that\u2019s pretty good. The question of voter fraud came up during the debate. We want fairness in the election. This is having nothing to do with me but having to do with the future of our country. We have to have fairness. John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, was quoted in Wikileaks as saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have their driver\u2019s license. What I\u2019m saying is don\u2019t be naive, folks. Don\u2019t be naive. One of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton campaign has paid people to disrupt violently our rallies and to incite absolute, total bedlam. It\u2019s so bad. So bad. And you know, I\u2019ve had occasions where we had rallies and it was so incredibly violent. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on over here?\u201d These were paid people by the Clinton campaign and it just came out and I give a lot of credit to the people that brought this out, believe me. This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition of peaceful, democratic elections. A campaign like Clinton\u2019s that will incite violence is truly a campaign that will do anything to win. And a candidate like crooked Hillary Clinton, who will lie to Congress, lie to the FBI, destroy 33,000 e-mails, put her office up for sale, and put our confidential information in the reach of our enemies is a candidate who is truly capable of anything, including voter fraud. In addition, it was just learned that Hillary Clinton was given the exact questions to a previous debate, word for word, by Donna Brazile, who is now under tremendous pressure to resign from the DNC, as she should be.

He started saying that he did not think that I had ever known love or I\u2019d ever been in love. I did not want to discuss my personal life with him. Then just before dinner arrived, he transformed into being all about business and began to question me as though I was on a job interview. Dinner was delivered to the bungalow. When dinner arrived, he asked me to wait in a small room. I felt that he did not want the waiter to see me. After the table was set, he beckoned me to come out. We shared a club sandwich.  The conversation then centered on the fact that I had a mortgage on my home, which I told him was in good standing. He spoke about how he was able to maneuver to get out of debt. He told me that I need to let my house go into default and tell the bank they could take it back. He advised that then the bank would then take anything to rid themselves of the problem loan. He told me to call the bank and tell them I was leaving the keys on the table and for them to just pick them up. He said that would be a mini version of what he does. He urged me not to make another payment on my home loan. He then abruptly said that he was tired and that he needed to go to bed and ended the conversation. He told me to meet him in the morning at his golf course in Palos Verdes. I was very conflicted as to what had occurred. I wondered if the sexual behavior was some kind of test or whether or not I had passed. Obviously, he still wanted to talk to me about a job even though I had turned his sexual advances down. From the hotel, I drove straight to our family business to speak to my father and he gave his advice. I decided to go to the golf course the next day. Mr. Trump introduced me to the general manager and he gave me a tour. When I got back from the tour, Mr. Trump was not there. I never saw him again. Mr. Trump called a few days later to ask if I had called the bank as he had instructed. I told him that it was Christmas Eve and that I had not done so as of yet. The general manager called me later that week and offered me a job at the golf course for half of what I had told Mr. Trump I was seeking in terms of salary. I called Mr. Trump and told him that I was upset and that I felt I was being penalized for not sleeping with him. Mr. Trump said that he was golfing and could not discuss it at that time. In a subsequent conversation about the job, Mr. Trump told me that I should never again use his private number and that if I wanted to reach him, I should contact him through his office. Even though Mr. Trump had sexually harassed me, I still wanted to get a job with the Trump organization. I felt that since I had made it clear to him that I was not interested in having a sexual relationship with him, that he\u2019d give me a job based solely on merit and we would be able to work together. When I contacted Mr. Trump, he asked me to send him a letter for jobs within his organization that I felt I was well-suited for, which I did. When I subsequently spoke with him, he gave me the runaround. He told me that he had not received the letter that I sent him and then told me that he cannot afford to hire me as he was laying off thousands of employees. I was disappointed but harbored no ill will towards Mr. Trump whatsoever and felt that there was no point in any further attempts to get a job with Mr. Trump. During Mr. Trump\u2019s fight with the Republican nomination, I saw and heard Mr. Trump non-stop on television and in the news. Customers at my restaurant asked about him as they knew I was a contestant on the Apprentice. I always complimented and never said anything about what he had done at the Beverly Hills Hotel. However, this caused me a great deal of pain and anguish and I felt the need to confront Mr. Trump and asked him to apologize for his behavior. I also thought he might have been embarrassed by his behavior and that this would provide him with the opportunity to clear the air. I had no idea that his behavior with other women at the time. Therefore, I contact his secretary in April of 2016 and asked I can reconnect with Mr. Trump. I did not tell her why I wanted to speak with him. She responded that perhaps his campaign team would follow up with me. I then wrote his assistant an email on April 21, 2016 asking her to send my email directly to Mr. Trump. In that email, I stated, \u201cYour interest in me as a potential employee have wronged me\u2026[incomprehensible audio]\u2026And I lost my footing.\u201d I further said I have been incredibly hurt by our previous interaction. I ended by stating, \u201cI hope to hear from you and wish you continued success.\u201d Mr. Trump did not reply. Mr. Trump, when I met you, I was so impressed with your talents that I wanted to be like you. I wanted a job within your organization. Instead, you treated as an object to be hit upon. I was incredibly embarrassed by your sexual advances and shared this information with a select few people close to me. Mr. Trump, today I feel that you were interested in me only because you wanted to have a sexual relationship with me and for no other reason. After hearing the released audio tapes and your denials during the debate, I felt I had to speak out about your behavior. You do not have the right to treat women as sexual objects just because you are a star. Thank you.

When I arrived, he kissed me on the lips. I was surprised but felt that perhaps it was just his form of greeting. We sat and spoke. He was extremely complimentary. He said he was impressed with how I handled myself on the Apprentice. He said that he had never met anyone with my combination of being smart, attractive, and with the largest set of balls as I had. He said he would love to have me work for him. Mr. Trump said he would be coming to Los Angeles soon and he would contact me. I felt as though I was reaching for my brass ring. I was very excited. I felt as though my dream of working for Mr. Trump might come true. As I was about to leave, he again kissed me on the lips. This made me feel nervous and embarrassed. This is not what I wanted or expected. He asked me for my phone number and I scrawled it down with a marker. I left hurriedly and called a friend in New York because I was upset by the kiss. I also called my parents to let them know what had happened. I spoke at length with my loved ones and we came to the conclusion this was undoubtedly some form of greeting and I should not take it as anything other than that. Mr. Trump called early in the morning of the day I returned home. He referred to me as his OC Angel. He wanted to know who was with me at that hour. He scolded me about my penmanship because it was difficult for him to read my telephone number as I had written for him. Even though he had called me, he concluded the call by asking me for my phone number. He then called again days later to let me know he was coming to Los Angeles. He again called me after he had just landed in Los Angeles. He asked me to meet him that evening at the Beverly Hills Hotel and asked me where I would like to have dinner. When I arrived, his security guard greeted me at the hotel. He walked with me to greet Mr. Trump. I assumed we were going to a restaurant in the hotel. Instead, I was taken to a bungalow. The security guard opened the door and I went in. I was standing in the entryway. To my left was a bedroom and I saw Mr. Trump\u2019s clothes on the bed. I did not see him but he greeted me with hello in a singing-song voice. It sounded like \u201cHellooooo.\u201d I thought that a mistake had been made and Mr. Trump thought he was speaking to someone he was more familiar with. I walked into the living room away from the bedroom and sat down. I waited for about 15 minutes until Mr. Trump emerged. He had his suit on. I stood up and he came to me and started kissing me open-mouthed as he was pulling me towards him. I walked away and I sat down in a chair. He was on a love seat across from me and I made an attempt at conversation. He then asked me to sit next to him. I complied. He then grabbed my shoulder and began kissing me again very aggressively and placed his hand on my breast. I pulled back and walked to another part of the room. He then walked up, grabbed my hand, and walked me into the bedroom. I walked out. He then turned me around and said, \u201cLet\u2019s lay down and watch some telly telly.\u201d He put me in an embrace and I tried to push him away. I pushed his chest to put space between us and I said, \u201cCome on, man, get real.\u201d He repeated my words back to me. \u201cGet real\u201d as he began thrusting his genitals. He tried to kiss me again with my hands still on his chest and I said, \u201cDude, you\u2019re tripping right now\u201d, attempting to make it clear I was not interested.   He said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d And I said, \u201cI came to have dinner.\u201d He said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll have dinner.\u201d He paced around the room. He acted like he was a bit angry. He pointed out that someone had delivered a fruit basket. I felt that it was to show me how important he was.

Our roads are bad. Our bridges are bad. Our tunnels are bad. Our schools are bad. Our hospitals are bad. We\u2019re going to start making things again in America. As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we\u2019re going to lower our business tax from 35% to 15%. The biggest since Ronald Reagan. Wages will rise. Jobs will return, and factories will come rushing \u2013 rushing \u2013 back in to our country. We\u2019re also going to fix our inner cities. 45% of African-American children are under the age of 6 are living in poverty. Think of it. 45%. 58% of African-American youths don\u2019t have jobs. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. 3,000 people since January. 3,000. It\u2019s like a war zone. Violent crime in Greensboro increased by 25% last year. Did you know that? 25%. To those African-Americans suffering in our country, I say what do you have to lose? Vote for Trump. I\u2019m going to fix it. What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? I will fight harder for you than anyone has fought for you before. Here is some of the more amazing things we\u2019re going to do when we takeover hopefully this incredible country and run it properly in 2017. We\u2019re going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan. We\u2019re going to eliminate job killing regulations, which are a disaster. We are going to defend religious liberty. We\u2019re going to end Common Core. We\u2019re going to bring our education local. We\u2019re going to support the men and women of law enforcement. Repeal and replace Obamacare. We are going to save our Second Amendment. We are going to appoint great justices to the United States Supreme Court, who uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. So you have 25 days to make every dream you\u2019ve ever dreamed of for your country come true. But to beat the system, you have to pound the pavement, get your friends and coworkers out, organize your neighbors and fight for the country you want. On Nov. 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voters. It\u2019s time. I\u2019m asking all Americans \u2013 Republicans, Independents, and Democrats \u2013 to join us in our campaign to defeat the corrupt establishment and give our government back to the people. It\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m going to fight for every citizen of every background. Thank you. So we\u2019re going to fight. And we\u2019re going to fight for every stretch of this nation. And I\u2019m going to fight to bring us all together. We\u2019re a divided nation \u2013 very divided nation right now. We\u2019re going to be an unified nation \u2013 a nation of love.

This is a movement like nobody\u2019s ever seen in this country before \u2013 even our enemies admit that. We\u2019re going to make history together. You\u2019re going to look back at the election on Nov. 8th and you\u2019re going to say it\u2019s the most important vote you\u2019ve ever cast because that\u2019s when our country started working again, that\u2019s when our country became safe again, that\u2019s when our country became strong again and rich again.

I think. Three very important words. Peace through strength. Right? And we don\u2019t want to use our strength but you have to have our strength and the world is laughing at us. They\u2019re laughing at the stupidity of our president. Remember he drew the land in the sand? The line is in the sand. Remember Hillary at the last debate? \u201cI wasn\u2019t Secretary of State then.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even know. It turned out she lied. Remember she said TPP was gold standard? She said she never said that. During the debate, she lied about that. She\u2019s a liar. But to be a strong country, we must also be a very rich country. At the center of our economic revival, we\u2019ll be fixing our really horrendous one-way street, horrible trade deals. We\u2019re going to fix them, folks. You know, last year, we lost almost $800 billion in trade deficits. We had trade deficits with other nations of almost $800 billion. And I have some friends in the audience. I guarantee you. I can take anyone of those friends \u2013 one in particular who happens to be brutal \u2013 but that\u2019s okay. Lives in North Carolina, so you know, one of those things. Right? But a great businessperson. I\u2019ll put him in charge\u2026we will have such a good thing. And there are people like that. We have the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest business people in the world. We don\u2019t use them. We use political hacks. So we have a trade deficit of almost $800 billion. Sad, isn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t it pathetic? North Carolina\u2019s industries and workers have been crushed by Bill Clinton\u2019s signing of NAFTA supported by crooked Hillary. Don\u2019t forget, a lot of people want that to happen because they make a lot of money by taking money out of this country. Those deals are very good for a lot of people. Everybody knows NAFTA is no good for the United States but it\u2019s good for their wallets in some cases. You\u2019ve lost nearly half of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Did you know that? You\u2019ve lost almost half of your manufacturing jobs. This region used to be the furniture manufacturing hub of the world. I know because I bought plenty. But the NAFTA deal and then China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary backed disaster \u2013 have sent those jobs to other countries. You know better than anybody. I used to be here a lot for furniture. Gets smaller and smaller every year, doesn\u2019t it? You\u2019re not going to have anything left pretty soon. We\u2019re living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Our jobs have been stolen from us and we have people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, in particular our leadership. If I win, on day one, we are going to announce our plan to re-negotiate NAFTA. If we don\u2019t get the deal we want, we\u2019ll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better, a much more fairer deal because right now, we\u2019re a one-way highway into Mexico \u2013 a one-way highway. I mean, you take a look at this. It\u2019s one-way. They get the jobs. They get the factories. They get the cash. And all we get? We get illegal immigration and we get drugs, and the drugs are poisoning our youths. The drugs are poisoning our youths and others. But we\u2019re getting the drugs and we\u2019re getting lots of problems. And I\u2019ll tell you I was endorsed by, as you know, by ICE and by the Border Patrol agents \u2013 16,500 border patrol. They\u2019ve never done this before. They\u2019ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. Both groups endorsed me because we\u2019re going to have strong borders. And we\u2019re going to have people come into our country but they\u2019re going to come in legally. Legally. And we\u2019re going to stand up to China. We\u2019re going to stop their currency manipulation, and product dumping, which is killing us. And they don\u2019t follow the rules, and if they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to institute tariffs when they send something into our country and believe me they are going to obey our rules so quickly you have no idea. And we\u2019ll end up with a better relationship with China than we do now. Look what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re building a massive fortress against everything. A massive fortress in the South China Sea. And yet, they\u2019re ripping us off. Now, if they\u2019re ripping us off, you wouldn\u2019t think they\u2019d be building fortresses.

The emails show that behind closed doors speaking to these international bankers, Hillary Clinton\u2019s pledged to destroy the sovereignty of the United States. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders better than you\u2019ve ever seen them before. And yes, we will build a wall. It will happen. Crooked Hillary also wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees to pour into our country. And that\u2019s over Obama numbers and those are thousands and thousands of people.

They\u2019re covering somebody that I never saw before\u2026 \u2026That she knows that terrorists are trying to infiltrate the refugee program. So you have terrorists coming in. She knows they\u2019re coming in, and yet she wants to increase it. Hillary\u2019s support for open borders in the Middle East will put us in the same position as France with multi-generational terrorism embedded in our community and our country will never be the same. So let me state this as clearly as I can. I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. At the same time, we\u2019re going to take care of our military and we\u2019re going to take care of our great, great, great veterans. They\u2019ve been treated very badly.

They will go outside. They\u2019ll go to a private doctor. They\u2019ll go to a private hospital. They\u2019ll go to a public hospital. We\u2019re going to get them care and we\u2019re going to pay for that care. They\u2019re not going to wait in line for seven days and die sometimes waiting in line for a simple, simple procedure or prescription. It\u2019s not going to happen like that any longer for our veterans. Okay? Not going to happen. And Hillary Clinton said no, no, the VA is doing a good job. Okay? North Carolina is home to more than 100,000 active duty military personnel and almost 800,000 veterans. The military supports over 500,000 jobs in this state.

He\u2019s given many millions of dollars to the Clintons and their initiatives. So Carlos Slim, largest donor of the paper, from Mexico. Reporters at the New York Times, they\u2019re not journalists.

And likewise, the emails show that the Clinton machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to the media organizations that she \u2013 listen to this \u2013 is given the questions and answers in advance of her debate performance with Bernie Sanders. Hillary Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times. They definitely do not do that to me. That I can tell you. And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton campaign on helping her win the election all over. With their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign. Not going to happen, which has now become a great, great movement, the likes of which our country has never seen before. Never ever. They\u2019ve never seen a movement like this in our country before. Yesterday in Florida, massive crowds. People lined up outside of big arenas, not able to get in. Never happened before. It\u2019s one of the great phenomenons, one of the great political phenomenons. The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media \u2013 the press. Let\u2019s be clear on one thing. The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism.

The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. As an example, just one single trade deal they\u2019d like to pass involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries, corporations, and lobbyists. For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don\u2019t have your good in mind. Our campaign represents a true existential threat like they haven\u2019t seen before. This is not simply another four year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government.

Believe me. For decades we\u2019ve talked about the corruption, incompetence, and failures of our leaders. 2016, our long-awaited chance. It\u2019s going to be our long-awaited chance to bring about real change, not Obama change, but real change. And remember this: Hillary Clinton will be four more years of Barack Obama. And maybe worse. And actually maybe worse. We can\u2019t let that happen. You\u2019re not going to have a country left. If you do this one simple thing, you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system. You have to show up and vote. When you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street board room filled with special interest, who\u2019ve been bleeding our country, who\u2019ve been bleeding Pennsylvania, who\u2019ve been taking your jobs. Take a look on their faces, and you will see smart people that know the game, but people that want to take your jobs and want to take your money. To them I say, \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d Oh, I could be doing The Apprentice right now. I could be. Somehow\u2013and I loved it. 14 seasons. How good was that? Tremendous success. They wanted to extend. I could be doing The Apprentice now. Somehow I think this is a little bit more important, do we agree? Just a little bit? And to the millions of unemployed Americans, we\u2019re going to say the two words that I really love. You know what they are? You\u2019re hired! You are hired. I\u2019m not a politician. I have no special interest. My only loyalty, and I mean this, I didn\u2019t need to do this, folks, believe me. This is tough work. This is a little bit like a lot of the people in this room, for 17, 18, and even 20 years, you had a better job 20 years ago than you have now. You got more money. Better job. Now you have a lot of years. You get less money. In many cases you\u2019re working two jobs and three jobs. So you\u2019re working harder, you\u2019re older, and you\u2019re making less money. Supposed to be the other way around. But the only thing I can say to you is I\u2019m also working harder. This is hard work. When they told me outside, \u201cSir, your helicopter cannot land tonight. The weather is terrible.\u201d I said, \u201cHow many people are out there?\u201d They said, \u201cAt least 15,000.\u201d I said, \u201cAre you crazy? Land the helicopter.\u201d No, there\u2019s no way we were going to miss it. And these are amazing people. We have amazing people in our country. I mean, we\u2019re going bring our country together everywhere. So my only loyalty is to you. This is my loyalty. I don\u2019t care about my company at that point. My kids will run it.

Like the European Union, she wants to erase our borders, and she wants to do it for her donors, and she wants people to pour into our country without knowing who they are. And you want to see problems? You watch. These special interests pay her for speeches and she\u2019s a lousy speaker. They pay her foundation. They pay her husband. In return they get your jobs. They get your jobs. And you\u2019re standing here from Pennsylvania, you\u2019re standing here right now, and I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s happened. People are negotiating and owners of companies are negotiating to move your companies out to Mexico and other places. You watch, and it\u2019s getting worse. It\u2019s not getting better; it\u2019s getting worse. And you\u2019re unsuspecting. Right now you say to your wife, \u201cLet\u2019s go to a movie after Trump,\u201d but you won\u2019t do that because you\u2019ll be so high and so excited that no movie is going to satisfy you. Okay? No movie. You know why? Honestly, because they don\u2019t make movies like they used to. Am I right? What a difference. Like I\u2019ve been saying all week, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, all you have to do is these three words \u2013 follow the money. One in three companies that lobbied for TPP passage donated to the Clinton Foundation as much as $67 million dollars. Nine companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP gave Hillary Clinton $2.7 million dollars for speeches. Now she does them for free and very few people show up. When she went to Pennsylvania last week. Did you see her? It was a small room. They couldn\u2019t fill the seats. Look at this place. Look at that. Hey media, turn your cameras over there. Turn your cameras over there. They don\u2019t do it. They never turn the cameras. The only time they turn the cameras because they\u2019re dishonest as hell. And you know, they don\u2019t realize one thing, if they showed the kind of\u2026 look at that all the way out to the door way past it and people outside. If they showed the kind of crowds we have, which people can hear, you know it\u2019s interesting. You can hear the crowd when you hear the television. You can hear the crowd, but if they showed it, it would be better television. But they don\u2019t know much about that but it would actually be better television. So three TPP member countries gave $6 and $15 million dollars to Clinton. At least four lobbyist who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more that $800,000 for her campaign. I\u2019m just telling you Pennsylvania. We\u2019re going to make it. We\u2019re going to make it, but we\u2019re going to make it. We\u2019re going to make it if we have Pennsylvania that\u2019s for sure. That would make it easy. But I\u2019m just telling you, you cannot let this pass. Not to pass.

How the hell do you hit 50% when you have like 11 people left? But then we lost a couple more. Very sad, very sad to watch. We were all broken up. Right?

You couldn\u2019t fit them in here. $1.7 billion in cash they paid to a terrorist nation. They paid to Iran. $1.7 billion. Or how about last week? They were going to deport 800 people. They were all ready for deportation, which means they had problems. But they made a mistake. And instead of deporting these 800 people back to the Middle East, guess what happened? They became United States citizens. And then that turned out be wrong just like the $400 million became $1.7 billion. Well, it looks like the 800 people are 1,700 people, and welcome, welcome, welcome, folks.

The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota \u2013 you all saw that last week \u2013 were foreign nationals admitted into our country, as was the mall shooter in Washington. Or look at cases like the Boston bombers here on asylum. Or the San Bernardino shooting here on a fiancee visa \u2013  fiancee, nice visa \u2013 from Saudi Arabia, killed 14s people that gave them a baby shower a short while before and she killed them. Not only killed them but many, many, many horribly wounded \u2019till this day. Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan. Terrorists are infiltrating our country. Now, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and countless more refugees from across the Middle East. I want to keep your families safe. My job is not to represent foreign countries. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States of America. Putting your jobs, your wages, and your security first. America first, remember that. America first. If you\u2019re living in the United States today as a lawful resident or a U.S. citizen, I will ensure you have a safe community, rising wages, and secure immigration system, which is what we want. Immigration security is national security. Very important. It\u2019s national security. Here are some of the things we will do starting in 2017. We are going to lower your taxes substantially. She\u2019s going to raise your taxes. We\u2019re going to eliminate every unnecessary regulation. We\u2019re going to repeal and replace job killing Obamacare. We will make child care affordable. We\u2019re going to save your Second Amendment, which is under siege. And I have the endorsement of the NRA, very early on. Thank you. We\u2019re going to support the men and women of law enforcement. And we\u2019re going to appoint justices to the Supreme Court of the United States who will uphold and defend our Constitution. We are going to finally rebuild America. We are going to revitalize America. We are going to unite America. We\u2019re going to come together as a people. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one American flag. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America \u2013 like your cap \u2013 we will make America great again. Thank you everybody. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Pueblo, Colorado \u2013 Part 10"}, {"text": "Hillary Clinton supports Obamacare and wants to expand it. And Obamacare is an absolute disaster. How much have they raised your premiums in this area? Double. Double. How about triple, quadruple? It\u2019s horrible, and it\u2019s going to die of its own weight. But we are going to terminate it and we are going to replace it, and it is going to be so much better and so much less expensive. Premiums in Colorado are set to go up another 20%. The only way to stop this disaster is to vote for Trump. I\u2019m telling you to vote for Trump. They will be going down. Hillary Clinton also supports the terrible trade deals like Bill Clinton\u2019s NAFTA and China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization. And next she wants to support Trans-Pacific partnership \u2013 the deal she calls the gold standard. That she lied to during the debate. She said she never called it the gold standard. And Lester Holt kept questioning me on everything, but he never questioned her on that. Right? And it turned out she called it the gold standard and she will approve it if she gets in. But if she gets in, that will be one bad mistake I can tell you. Colorado has lost more than one in seven manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China deals. But while you\u2019ve lost out, Hillary Clinton has raked in cash from her contributors. She and Bill have made $150 million dollars in speeches \u2013 and she\u2019s a bad speaker \u2013 to special interests. They gave 39 speeches to big banks, including $2 million in speaking fees to Goldman Sachs. The Clintons received another $2 million from a Swiss Bank after Hillary negotiated a favorable settlement for them as Secretary of State. To hide the corruption, Hillary Clinton puts her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena to hide them from the public. She lies to Congress under oath. And her ring leaders took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals. Explain that one. In so many ways, it\u2019s worse than Watergate. The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged and it\u2019s a shame. And it\u2019s one of the saddest things that has ever taken place in our nation. Believe me, what\u2019s gone on. We\u2019ve become a Banana Republic. You know what? We have. Now today we learned that the FBI may have made a side deal with Clinton\u2019s top aides to destroy their laptops. Did you know this? Let me repeat, the FBI reportedly made a deal to destroy the laptops of government officials implicated in a massive criminal cover-up. I think you have a lot of great people in the FBI and you do indeed. I think they\u2019re extremely upset at what\u2019s going on. Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels. And the American people have one chance to stop it \u2013 by showing up and voting on Nov. 8th. People have had it with the years and decades of Clinton corruption. This is the year the American people say enough is enough. The Clintons are the sordid past. We are together, as a movement all of us, outside of this area, all over the country, we are the bright future. Now another issue I want to address today finally is immigration. As I\u2019ve mentioned, Pueblo is filled with wonderful hard working immigrants. It\u2019s these hard working immigrants who stand to lose the most from our open border immigration policy. Illegal immigration and broken visa programs take jobs directly from Latino and Hispanic workers living here lawfully today. You know that. They\u2019re taking your jobs. Illegal immigration also brings with it massive crime and massive drugs, including a terrible heroin problem right here in Colorado. You have a big problem.

And as Americans, you\u2019re entitled to the same protections as every other American gets. Everyone living lawfully inside our borders are entitled to the same things \u2013 safe communities, a great education, and access to high paying jobs and really good jobs. And this isn\u2019t happening\u2026[inaudible] change that I will deliver. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years delivering nothing but talk and failure. You know the other night when we\u2019re at the debate, I noticed more than ever before, we\u2019re at the debate and she says she\u2019s going to do this or this or this or that. And I said to myself, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t she been doing it for 30 years?\u201d Right? Just talk. Her policies have brought death and destruction overseas and poverty at home. She\u2019s brought massive poverty for everyone, but especially for African American and Latino citizens. She comes in, tries to get their vote. Although I must tell you the enthusiasm for her is very small. Don King, the great boxing promotor, who endorsed me, said \u201cDonald, the African-Americans, Donald, love you.\u201d Don King, big Don. And here\u2019s a man whether you like him or not that\u2019s a smart cookie, a tough cookie, and he\u2019s done a job, he\u2019s done a job. But he said, \u201cYou are going to see a big surprise on Nov. 8th with\u201d \u2013 and in this case he was talking about the African Americans \u2013 he said, \u201cYou going to see a big surprise because so many African-American people love you, and they want you to really help them out in terms of the inner cities in particular where it\u2019s so dangerous, where education is so bad, where jobs are non existent, where youth cannot get jobs.\u201d So I want to thank Don King and so many others for their endorsement. We had so many others so many reverends and pastors. Bishop Jackson from Detroit, incredible people. Darrell Scott, Pastor Darrell Scott, so many, and I\u2019m so honored by it. Believe me, I am honored by it. And Don said that Hillary Clinton takes the African-American vote for granted. Here\u2019s the bad news, I don\u2019t think their gonna want to go out and vote for her. This is not Barack Obama where they really had spirit to vote for him. Nobody has spirit. Remember she called African-American male youth \u201csuper predators\u201d? Who wants to vote for her? She\u2019s not going to do the job anyway. She opposes school choice, and she wants to trap African-American and Latino children into the failing government schools because she\u2019s getting a lot of money from the teacher\u2019s unions. So, she doesn\u2019t want to have choice. And she doesn\u2019t want to end Common Core so we can bring education locally, which is very important. She doesn\u2019t want to do that. We\u2019re going to get poor minority\u2026[inaudible]\u2026 I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m telling you the Commission on Presidential Debates is operating this microphone.

And by the way Mike Pence on Tuesday night. He has been fantastic. Governor Mike Pence, what a fantastic guy. Tuesday night! Tuesday night! We are going to get poor minority children out of failing schools and then into the public, private charter or magnet school of their choice. Going to be a big difference.

We\u2019re going to change things around. The thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is absolutely impossible. For me, impossible is just a starting point. That\u2019s when you begin. \u2026With $20 trillion in debt and a $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities, a lot of people say it\u2019s impossible. We are sitting on a big, fat, ugly bubble.

They said, \u201cWell, you have a lot of Hispanics/Latinos in Pueblo.\u201d I said I think that\u2019s why they are going to like me actually. That\u2019s why they are going to like me. Believe me.

The Hillary people are not in the same category. If Bernie Sanders had not made the deal with the devil, he would have gone down in the history of politics as a very rare and unique person. But when he made that deal, and I know that he wished he didn\u2019t, his followers were lost. He had an event recently where 150 people showed up to hear him talk. And I will say this, we\u2019ve always had by far the biggest crowds. But you know what? He was second. He was second. But he made a deal with the devil and his supporters are really no longer his supporters any longer. That I can tell you. And you know one of the things that Bernie Sanders and I agreed on is trade. And trade is something that is so sad for our country. What\u2019s happening, how your jobs are being taken. The difference is, I can do something about it and make a bad deal into a great deal. All he knew is it was bad. And we want to do something about it. We just can\u2019t be a critic. This is a city with a rich immigrant history and a rich Latino history. The Latinos love Trump, right?

Everybody said that I was done. There were front page articles in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, among many others. They were thrilled and delighted. And I\u2019m still here. Can you believe these people? They must be going crazy. Can you believe it? The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, they are going crazy. They say 1990\u2019s and now here I am still. They say \u201cCan we ever get rid of this guy?\u201d But they were thrilled to write these negative stories. So they said I was finished. The only person who didn\u2019t think that I was in trouble was a guy named Donald J. Trump. I didn\u2019t think I was in trouble. I sort of didn\u2019t know what they were talking about. Does that make sense? Power of positive thinking. But I didn\u2019t know what they were talking about. I started my company with a small loan, and as I grew I borrowed money to grow the company. And big money from big banks. When the bottom fell out from the real estate market, I had this large amount of debt and it stayed the same but the value of assets plummeted. So you have to learn. I was young so you have to learn. And I learned, and I worked really hard. But I knew how to use the tax code to rebuild my company when others didn\u2019t. I knew how to understand, and I fully understood the banks and the bankers and how to deal with them. I knew a lot. But my understanding of the tax code gave me a tremendous advantage over those who didn\u2019t have a clue about it, including many of my competitors who lost everything they had, never to be heard from again.

But in tough times, you need very tough and very smart people. These are tough times for America. And I will tell you, we need very tough and very smart leadership. Not people who tell you what you want to hear, but people who tell you what you need to hear. We must never allow corrupt career politicians like the Clintons ever back into the White House again. These tough times were when I performed my very best. The economy and banks, they were collapsing. The government was a mess. But I enjoyed waking up everyday to go to battle, and that\u2019s what it was for three years. I had an expression in the early 90\u2019s, \u201cSurvive until \u201995 and you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d And people copied it. Survive till \u201995. I enjoyed getting up every morning to take on the financial establishment on behalf of my company, my employees, my family and myself and win. And that\u2019s what we did. I won, I won, and I kept on winning, \u2018till this day. I kept on winning. All you have to do is ask all of the 17 people that we competed against and you\u2019ll ask them, \u201cHow did Trump do?\u201d They\u2019ll say, \u201cHe won.\u201d But that\u2019s the thinking we need for our country. That\u2019s the thinking we need when we\u2019re negotiating trade deals, which are horrible. And military deals and economic deals on behalf of the American people. We need great people negotiating our deals for us. We have the greatest negotiators and the greatest business people in the world. And we use political hacks to negotiate our deals. Not anymore we\u2019re not. Not anymore. Put me into the boardroom as your representatives, and I promise I will deliver.

I thought that\u2019s a beautiful commission. Let\u2019s see what happens on Sunday again. My biggest opponent was the microphone. And now our country is in need of a major comeback. It needs one now just about more than ever. We owe $20 trillion in debt, doubled during Obama\u2019s period as president. Doubled. Think of it. But that\u2019s only part of the story. We have over $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and we have a budget that\u2019s out of control with annual deficits. In addition, because of the incompetence of our leaders, we run massive trade deficits on an annual basis. I\u2019ll get Bernie to negotiate a couple of these trade deals, you\u2019ll find out.

We have failing schools. We have rising crime. We have a depleted military \u2013 are great people and a depleted military. We have planes that are so old they go to airplane graveyards to take out parts. They go to museums to take out parts \u2018cause they don\u2019t make the parts anymore. We have an open border.

Mexico is going to pay for the wall. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay for the wall. And you have a tremendous problem right here. But we\u2019re going to have drugs stop pouring into our country, destroying our youth, poisoning our people. Poisoning our people. We are a divided nation, and each week it seems we\u2019re getting more and more divided with race riots on our streets on a monthly basis. Somebody said don\u2019t call them race riots, but that\u2019s what they are. They\u2019re race riots. And it\u2019s happening more and more. You looked at Charlotte, a great city where I have property. A great city. You look at different places around our country. St. Louis, Ferguson, Baltimore, Chicago. In Chicago, thousands of shootings, thousands since Jan. 1st. 4,000 shootings, think of it, since January. This is not the America that was handed down to us, and it\u2019s not the America that we want to leave to our children. And it\u2019s certainly not the America we want to pass down to our grandchildren. But this is the America we will have if we don\u2019t turn things around starting immediately. We don\u2019t have much time, folks. We don\u2019t have much time. And if we don\u2019t win this election, it will never happen again. This opportunity is never going to happen again. What I say is not lost on the American people because 70% of you believe our country is headed in the wrong direction. And I\u2019m trying to figure out who the other 30% are. I want to meet them. We cannot have another four years of Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton will be worse. She will be worse. We can turn our country around.

That\u2019s because I knew in my heart that when the chips are down is when I perform the very best. That is always when I perform the best. It\u2019s when I make my best decisions, judgments. You remember Bernie saying Hillary Clinton has bad judgement? And honestly my single greatest asset probably is temperament because if you didn\u2019t have the right temperament, you could have never escaped that financial jungle. That\u2019s for sure. Single greatest asset is my temperament. And I have a temperament for winning. You have to win. We have a temperament all of us for winning.

I understand it. I get it. And that is what I commit to do. We want fairness. We want money brought in. And we want money to be spent when it goes out because they spend our tax dollars so unfairly and unwisely. Remember that. As a businessman and real estate developer, I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit and to the benefit of my company, my investors, and my employees. I mean honestly, I have brilliantly \u2013 I have brilliantly used those laws. I have often said on the campaign trail that I have a fiduciary responsibility to pay no more tax than is legally required like anybody else. Or put it another way, to pay as little tax as legally possible. And I must tell you, I hate the way they spend our tax dollars. And believe me, that makes a difference. As a major real estate developer in this country and throughout the world, I face enormous taxes \u2013 city taxes, state taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes, employee taxes, federal taxes, VAT taxes (different countries). It\u2019s my job to minimize the overall tax burden to the greatest extent possible, which allows me to re-invest in neighborhoods and in workers and build amazing properties, which fuel tremendous growth in their communities, and always help our great providers of jobs and we have to help our small businesses. What it\u2019s all about. What it\u2019s all about. The news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990\u2019s at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our country\u2019s history. If you remember the early 90\u2019s, other than I would say 1928, there was nothing even close. The conditions facing real estate developers in that early \u201990 period were almost as bad as the Great Depression of 1929 and far worse than the Great Recession of 2008. Not even close. What had been a booming economy in the era of Ronald Reagan changed dramatically and the business landscape changed with it. Bank failures and collapse. The absolute total destruction of the savings and loan industry. And the implosion of the retail market and real estate in general. Something we\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Many businesspeople, including many of my competitors and some of my friends, were not able to survive. Companies, jobs, and opportunities were lost, and lives were destroyed as tens of thousands of people were put out of work. Some of the biggest and strongest people and companies went absolutely bankrupt, which I never did by the way. Are you proud of me? I would have loved to use that card but I just didn\u2019t want to do it. Thank you. Yet today, my company is bigger, stronger, far greater assets than it\u2019s ever had before. More premium properties. We\u2019ve never done better. It\u2019s the strongest we\u2019ve ever been. And we employ thousands of people, and over the years have employed thousands and thousands of people, which is a thing that frankly makes me most happy. That did not happen by chance or luck. It happened by action and talent \u2013 lot of talent. I was able to use the tax laws of this country and my business acumen to dig out of the real estate mess. You would call it a depression. When few others were able to do what I did in those most \u2013 I\u2019m a star. Thank you. You are too \u2013 Oh, they were amazing times.

And those two gentlemen are amazing men and I want to thank them for being with us. You know, Pueblo is called home of the heroes. Did you know that? Because of your proud tradition of military service. Pueblo\u2019s the home of four Medal of Honor recipients and I just got the endorsement of 19 altogether, 19. So when you have 19, that\u2019s pretty good. But you have 4 which is amazing. As President Eisenhower said, \u201cThere must be something in the water out here in Pueblo\u201d. Because all of you guys turn out to be heroes. What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s going on? Is there something in the water? Give me some of that water. Colorado is home to six military bases. We\u2019re going to eliminate the defense sequester and rebuild our military. We\u2019re going to strengthen it. We\u2019re gonna make it truly, truly, strong again. Another great Colorado legacy is hunting and fishing. My sons know that very well. They\u2019re here all the time. We\u2019re going to conserve your lands for the future generations, and we\u2019re going to save your Second Amendment, which is under siege. You know, a lot of people in this room, this is very impressive. Thank you.  Thank you. It\u2019s a great honor. It\u2019s a great honor. One other issue of such great importance in Colorado is energy. Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the mines and shut down shale and shut down oil and natural gas, and we\u2019re going to end the war on American energy, and we are going to put the miners back to work. They have to be put back to work. I\u2019ve also made a centerpiece of my economic revitalization plan the largest middle class tax cuts since Ronald Reagan and the largest regulatory reform in American history. We\u2019re gonna do that. And Hillary Clinton is going to increase your taxes very, very substantially, and she admits it. At least she admits it. But that\u2019s because I know how over taxed and over regulated the working people and companies in this country are. A central issue I would like to address today is our broken tax code, an issue of concern to all Americans, along with securing our borders, rebuilding our military, keeping us safe from terrorism, re-doing our trade deals and bringing back jobs \u2013 they\u2019re sort of one and the same. Fixing our broken tax code is one of the main reasons I\u2019m running for president. I\u2019ve been saying from the beginning of this campaign, how ridiculous, complex and, yes, unfair the tax system is. It is an unfair system. And so complex that very few people understand it. Fortunately, I understand it. This is not the fault of the IRS, but the political class that is owned outright by the special interests and lobbyists. Believe me. It\u2019s these politicians who wrote the tax code and who are constantly adding, revising, and changing an already over complicated set of laws \u2013 all at the behest of their favorite donors and special interests who want certain provisions put in and they won\u2019t take no for an answer. It\u2019s thousands of pages long and almost no one understands it. The average American would need an army of accountants and lawyers to wade through and wade through it. Many so called experts, due to the sheer size and complexity of the code, don\u2019t have a clue what these pages represent. These are experts. They get paid and they don\u2019t even know what it represents. The unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been talking about for a long time despite quite frankly being a big beneficiary of the laws. But I\u2019m working for you now. I\u2019m not working for Trump.

Hillary Clinton\u2019s war on energy will cost our economy $5 trillion at least. She\u2019s not only declared war on the miners, but on all oil and natural gas production. It\u2019s war. Which supports 10 million jobs in the United States. And you people know it\u2019s war. It\u2019s going to be worse under her than it\u2019s been under President Obama. Access to low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the American chemical industry, which supports 40,000 jobs in the state of Pennsylvania. We have just begun, as a nation, to recognize our economic advantage, that is made possible by shale energy. The shale energy revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and their families. At the same time, this energy revolution will produce new demand for American steel, and that means the steel workers will benefit. And the steel workers today are having a very, very hard time. That business is going down on a yearly basis. We are going to benefit the steel workers and the steel business. But federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically and energy production in general. Currently less than 10% of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development. Almost 90% of our nation\u2019s offshore acreage is off limits to energy production. In many cases, there is absolutely no reason for that. Our energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources. We want everything. That means we will end the war on coal and the war on our miners. I will rescind the coal-mining lease moratorium, which is a horrible moratorium and so unfair. The excessive Interior Department stream rule and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama administration. We will eliminate the highly invasive Waters of the U.S. rule and scrap the $5 trillion  Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan. These unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by double-digits without any measurable improvement in climate, whatsoever. Very unfair to our people and our workers. I will re-focus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air and clean, safe drinking water for all Americans. That\u2019s what we want. I believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats. My environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas that are putting our country behind the eight ball. It will be a future of conservation, of prosperity, and of great success for the people in this room, and for all of those people that you employ, the tens of thousands of great people that you employ.

I think it is. Compare that to my opponent. She plans a $1.3 trillion tax hike, massive new regulations, and some of your industries sitting right in this room are out of business. The offshoring of American jobs and the aggressive restriction of American energy production. Her plan will help only her wealthy donors and global special interests who benefit from the rigged system. And we are in a rigged system. Hillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work, ban hydraulic fracking in almost all places, and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public land and in most offshore areas. That\u2019s what she said. Remember she said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to put the miners out of work\u201d? This will produce devastation for states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and so many others where shale oil and shale energy and coal and coal production are critical parts of the economy. I go to the coal areas and it\u2019s like devastation. And these are amazing people. Unbelievable people. Her plan hurts states like Colorado, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resources. She also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that\u2019s needed to move our energy resources to the market place. According to the Wall Street Journal, overall more than a dozen fossil fuel projects, worth about $33 billion, have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012 only with billions more tied in projects still in regulatory limbo. They won\u2019t happen either. Now, if I\u2019m president, they\u2019ll happen quickly. I will tell you that. Happen very quickly. You\u2019ll be amazing at how quickly they\u2019ll happen. Examples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an $850-million coal export facility in Washington, a $3 billion natural gas pipeline in the Northeast, and a $6.8-billion liquid natural gas export facility among others. Many others. Billions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the Obama-Clinton restriction agenda, and many many, many billions more to follow. The platform produced by Hillary Clinton\u2019s party this year also calls for a price on carbon. That\u2019s just political speak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production \u2013 a tax on American consumers. And it\u2019s very unfair to our country and it makes it very unfair and very uncompetitive to do business with other countries. Very. It makes it so tough to compete with other countries. And remember every energy dollar that isn\u2019t harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country \u2013 often foreign countries not very friendly to us. That not only means, so true, that we\u2019re sending our jobs to those countries but it means that energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards, which we want to keep. That is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of America\u2019s vast energy resources and reserves. We need an American first energy plan. It\u2019s going to be from now on America First. This means opening federal lands for oil and gas production, opening offshore areas, and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies.

Creating countless more jobs for our country in the process. Overall my entire economic plan \u2013 tax reform, regulatory reform, energy reform, and trade reform will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years assuming an average growth rate of 3.5%. And I believe we can reach beyond actually 4% growth. Why not? And just so you know, when China does 7% or even 8%, it\u2019s a major panic in the country. They then start devaluing of course and they get their numbers up, much to our chagrin. My tax plan includes a 15% business rate, think of that, so that we\u2019re reducing taxes from 35% all the way down for business to 15%, turning America into a jobs magnet. Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses as high as 45% and probably even higher than that. And as far as regulations are concerned it will be beyond anything you\u2019re experiencing right now. So you better get everybody out to vote, folks, or you can sort of forget it, and all these jobs that we\u2019re talking about will go in the opposite direction. Income taxes will be simplified from seven brackets to three, and middle class Americans will get a major tax cut including child care deductions and tax-free child care savings accounts. My plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety. Over-regulation is costing our economy $2 trillion a year. And I think probably no other business has been affected than your business by over-regulation. And one of the things I\u2019ve seen, despite this massive tax cut, the biggest since Ronald Reagan and maybe beyond that, from 35% to 15%, people are more excited when I talk about the fact that we\u2019re going to be cutting massively regulations. We need regulations for safety and environment but regulations are becoming a major industry right now. We\u2019re going to make it a much smaller industry, maybe a minor industry. Your regulations are going to be cut back to a point that you\u2019ll be able to have your businesses, grow your businesses, and start new businesses, and you\u2019ll never be able to do that with what has taken place over the last eight years. I just think it\u2019s a really important thing. What has really impressed me is people in business have actually felt more strongly about that than the tax cut itself. So I understand that very well. On energy, my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrow. Finally, my plan includes a re-negotiation of America\u2019s trade deals and an enforcement of trade rules to increase jobs and wealth inside the U.S. We have people right in this room that could do so well for us. We have negotiators of our trade deals who are political hacks, who are people that don\u2019t know the first thing about negotiation. Of course, you could just look at the Iran deal and you\u2019ll understand that. The deal that was just made recently with Iran. What a deal that is. I mean, we have half of this room could have negotiated a deal 10 times better, and a lot of the room just wouldn\u2019t have made a deal and that would have been a lot better. But they did something that you folks\u2026never saw before. We thought it was $400 million in cash. Cash. Not like a check. $400 million in cash. It was $1.7 billion in cash. And even you.

It\u2019s tough being a police officer. And it\u2019s hard now even recruiting police officers. It\u2019s a tremendous problem. Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything that we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and any wrongdoing is always \u2013 and it will be by them \u2013 vigorously addressed.

I knew I\u2019d have to make that statement in order to get you guys a little bit enlivened. You\u2019ll like the rest of what I\u2019m going to say even more. America is sitting a treasure trove of untapped energy. Some $50 trillion in shale energy, oil reserves, and natural gas on federal lands in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves. It\u2019s all upside for this country \u2013 more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages, and lower energy prices. I\u2019m going to lift the restrictions on American energy and allow this wealth to pour into our communities, including right here in the state of Pennsylvania that we love. According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on American energy, including shale production, will accomplish the following: Increase GDP by more than $100 billion each year. That\u2019s good music. Add over 500,000 new jobs annually. Increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next seven years. Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues almost $6 trillion over four decades. Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years. In addition, we will probably streamline the permitting process, which probably makes you happier even than when I\u2019m going to say we\u2019re lowing taxes. The permitting process in your industry is a disaster. It\u2019s a disaster. Every friend I have in your industry, they tell me it has become horrible with the EPA.

It\u2019s their job, housing markets, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety. We have to do that. There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration. Never. Ever. Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace,  to walk their kids to school, and to get their children great educations.

For every one violent protester, there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at night, to be able to walk on the streets, to be able to go to the grocery store. More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs. And we need it quickly. Last year we saw 17% rise in violent crime in our 50 largest cities.

This is a national crisis and it\u2019s the job of the next president of the United States to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and safe African-American lives. Look at the example that we had in New York of Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has been a tremendous person for me and a good friend of mine for a long time and a big endorsement. Big, big endorsement. The policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76% and murder in New York by 84%. Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable.

Probably has some problem that we don\u2019t know about. But he\u2019s a nasty guy and he spoke badly about Bush. He spoke badly about Obama. He speaks badly about everybody. Never met the guy. Never saw him. I saw him on television. Didn\u2019t like him. The end result of this is look where we are. He\u2019s a mess. Okay? He\u2019s a mess. So he goes out and says negative things about me. I never met him. I never talked to him. Believe me. I am so much better at what he\u2019s doing than he is. You won\u2019t even believe it. Look at what he gave us. Look at the mess of all the these people that have been there for so many years. Look at what we have. Look at the Middle East. If we never touched them, we would\u2019ve been a hell of lot better of than we are right now. What a shame. All of that the money but most importantly, the blood, the death. And what do we have now? We\u2019re in worse shape than we were 15 years ago by a factor of 10. And we\u2019ve spent $6 trillion. $6 trillion. That seems to be the new number. $6 trillion. Much more importantly, the lives that we\u2019ve lost because we\u2019re dealing with incompetent people. We\u2019re dealing with stupid people. We\u2019re dealing with people like Robert Gates that don\u2019t have clue. And then when they leave office, they criticize everybody. I don\u2019t like critics. I don\u2019t like critics. I like the people that get it done and get it done right. We need to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous future. We can do that. Jobs will return. Incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores. That\u2019s what we have to have. Once more, we will have a government of, by, and for the people.

Earlier this week, along with my daughter Ivanka, I also wrote \u2013 she has a great heart, that I wrote down here \u2013 I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable child care. A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill. A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in your tax bill. Millions of low income people will be removed from the tax rolls entirely. A Trump administration will deliver every American 3 things: A great economy, a safe country and an honest government, free of corruption. We are going to get rid of it. I am going to reduce taxes. We are going to reduce taxes. And by the way, Hillary Clinton is going to raise your taxes very very substantially. We are going to reduce taxes, eliminate horrible regulations, unleash American energy, appoint the great judges, save the Second Amendment, reduce crime, create school choice, end illegal immigration, and renegotiate our terrible trade deals to put Americans back to work and to put Americans first. We will rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads. American planes will soar the skies. And American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds and that includes Denver. They have some very nice skyscrapers. American hands will rebuild this nation. And American energy mined from American sources will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American steel into the spine of our country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation, and I will fight to bring us all together united in common purpose and common dreams.

There\u2019s $50 trillion of untapped energy reserves in our country, and we\u2019re going to unlock that vast potential. That\u2019s going to be an amazing unlocking, too, believe me.

It\u2019s going to be a very beautiful thing to watch. We\u2019re also going to complete reform our trade deals. Ford, Ford Motor Company, just announced they\u2019re moving all of their small car division. They\u2019re moving. Where are they moving? They\u2019re moving to Mexico. This won\u2019t happen if I\u2019m elected President, believe me. People are not going to be stealing our companies, and we\u2019re not going to be losing our jobs. And if somebody like Ford or Carrier or all of these thousands of companies that are moving. If they think they\u2019re going to move, fire all of their employees, so we get unemployment or we get no tax. They\u2019re going to make product and brand new plants in another country, sell it into our country against \u2013 and remember this, it will now be crossing a very very strong border. Very strong. We\u2019re going to charge them a 35% tax on their product. And you know what they\u2019re going to say? They\u2019re going to say, \u201cWe\u2019re not moving because if we have to do that, it no longer makes sense to move.\u201d And the politicians could have done it. They could have done it. They don\u2019t want to do it because they\u2019re controlled by special interests, folks. It\u2019s very simple. Meanwhile, if we just stopped China from stealing our intellectual property alone, we\u2019d save two million jobs a year. We don\u2019t even talk to China about it. Right now, our trade deficit in goods all over the world is nearly $800 billion a year. Think of it. Who makes these deals? Who makes these deals? We have a trade deficit of $800 billion a year. And then they say I\u2019m against trade. Well, I\u2019m against deals like that, I can tell you. You\u2019re better off without them. This subtracts from our GDP. Our economy grew only 1.1% in the last quarter, and that\u2019s a catastrophe. If China goes down to 7 or 8 % it\u2019s like a national emergency. We have 1.1%. It\u2019s pathetic. This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Another 14 million people have left the workforce and, entirely, it all came in entirely, since President Obama came into office. Another major reform is going to be school choice. I\u2019ve outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America to chose the private, public, magnate, or religious school of his or her choice. For those of you who believe in education, like I do, this will help lift millions of African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.

Her policies have produced suffering everywhere, but especially in our inner cities. 45% of African-Americans under the age six are living in poverty. 58% of African-American youth are not employed. More than 3,000 people have been shot in the city of Chicago since Jan. 1st. Can you imagine? By the way, by the way, that\u2019s worse than Afghanistan. That\u2019s worse than these war-torn countries! It\u2019s more dangerous. The jobs are gone. The schools are failing. The communities are totally unsafe.

Bill O\u2019Reilly said one of the great phenomenas he\u2019s ever seen. He\u2019s actually said it\u2019s the greatest political phenomena he\u2019s seen in his lifetime. But I\u2019ll tell you something, it doesn\u2019t mean anything if we don\u2019t win. We gotta win. We gotta win. It\u2019s going to be a victory for the people. It\u2019s going to be a victory for you all the way in that corner over there. Boy, we have a lot of people here. This is a big hangar and it\u2019s full. Big hangar, and I appreciate it. Starting in 2017, anything we dream for our country will be achieved. It\u2019s going to be achieved. It\u2019s time to start thinking of dreaming big. We don\u2019t dream big anymore in this country. Bigger than all of those petty politicians that don\u2019t have a clue, believe me. Our plan begins with economic prosperity. My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words. You know what they are? Jobs, jobs, jobs. We\u2019re going to have a massive tax reduction \u2013 big, big league tax reduction for working and middle class families. We\u2019re going to reduce \u2013 and this is so important \u2013 reduce job-killing regulations and raise your incomes way up high. We\u2019re going to keep our good jobs. We have bad jobs. We are going to get our good jobs back; they\u2019ve been sucked away. We\u2019re going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean \u2013 you know, these press, they are so dishonest. I\u2019m all for trade but we want good deals. We don\u2019t want bad deals. When I say I\u2019m going renegotiate, they say Trump\u2019s anti-trade. I\u2019m totally for trade but we\u2019re going to have great deals for our country. We\u2019re going to have job-producing deals, not job-sucking deals, which are getting sucked out of our country. We\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare.

To bring the wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those to who have not had these opportunities before. And that\u2019s many, many people in Detroit.

We had a fantastic interview with Bishop Jackson. It was really an amazing interview. He\u2019s better than the people who do that professionally. And I didn\u2019t really know what I was getting myself into. I didn\u2019t know. Is this going to be nice? Is this going to be wild? He is a great gentlemen and a very smart guy. And I just hope you do not lose him to Hollywood. That\u2019s the only problem. Especially Dr. Jackson. She may be gone. Hollywood is calling. Look at all those television cameras back there. Look at all those television cameras. I am sorry to do that to you Bishop because you know, one of those things. Right? Our nation is too divided. We talk past each other, not to each other. And those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on. They don\u2019t know. They have no clue. I am here today to learn so that we can together remedy injustice in any form and so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways. Our political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself. I want to reform that system so that it works for you, everybody in this room. I believe true reform can only come from outside the system. I really mean that. Being a business man is much different from being a politician because I understand what is happening, and we are going outside of the establishment. Becoming the nominee of the party of Abraham Lincoln \u2013 a lot of people do not realize that Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln, was a Republican \u2013 has been the greatest honor of my life. It is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the party, but more importantly the future of the country and the community. I believe we need a civil rights agenda for our time \u2013 one that ensures our rights to a great education; it\u2019s so important, and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really, really great job, a good paying job and one that you love to go to every morning. And that can happen. We need to bring our companies back. It also means the right to have a government that protects our workers and fights, really fights, for our jobs. I want to help you build and rebuild Detroit. And we can do that, especially with people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. It has been an amazing experience. It\u2019s been an amazing experience. Nothing is more sad than when we sideline young black men with unfulfilled potential, tremendous potential. I met some people this morning that were incredible people and they looking for jobs.

For centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country, so true. It\u2019s from the pews and pulpits, teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil Rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation. It\u2019s from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character and deeper concern for mankind and spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together and we are bound together and I see that today. This has been an amazing day for me. The African-American faith community has been one of God\u2019s greatest gifts to America and to its people. There is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide greater platform to the black churches and church goers. You do right every day by your community and your families. You raise children in the light of God. And I will always support your church, always and defend your right to worship. So important. I am here today to listen to your message and I hope my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought, I can tell you that. Christian faith is not the past but the present and the future. Make it stronger. And we\u2019ll open it up to great, great, leaders like Pastor Jackson, Bishop Jackson, Dr. Jackson and so many others and so many others actually sitting here. Darrell Scott, we have, who is phenomenal, who has been with me for so long, so long. Omarosa, who is also a very nice person, but I don\u2019t want to say that because I\u2019ll destroy her image by saying that. She\u2019s actually a very, very, very fine person and a pastor. And I just want to thank all of the folks and there is somebody that\u2019s been very special to me, Dr. Ben Carson, whose been, stand up Ben, come here. This is a great man and a great guy. So as I prepare to campaign all across the nation and in every community, I will have an opportunity to lay out my plans for economic change, which will be so good for Detroit and so good for this community because we are going to bring jobs back.

They see job-creation, which is so important. And it\u2019s really been amazing. And one of the things that they see, and that you people see, is that it\u2019s so important \u2013 the judges. So, I picked 11 judges very much into the world of the Constitution. Because we have \u2013 we have people that in some cases \u2013 I think in all cases \u2013 that will, the Constitution will have no bearing on their decisions, okay, if somebody else gets it.

And they\u2019re really, really amazing judges. And I will pick from that group. And these judges- you know we lost Judge Scalia- and these judges are very much the mold of Judge Scalia. So, I think it\u2019s very important \u2013 so important. So important. This election, those people and those Republicans that aren\u2019t helping \u2013 they should be ashamed of themselves.

I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up. That man went to the car hands up, put his hands on the car. And to me, it looked like he did everything you\u2019re supposed to do. And he looked like a really good man, and maybe I\u2019m a little clouded because I saw his family talking about him after the fact. So, you get a little bit different image, maybe, but to me he looked like, you know, somebody who was doing what they were asking him to do.

And, we\u2019ve seen others, we\u2019ve seen others. And, the police are aware of that, too. By the way, the police are troubled by it, too. They look at it\u2026Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But, maybe people like that, people that choke, maybe they can\u2019t be doing what they\u2019re doing. Okay? They can\u2019t be doing stuff like that.

Their small cars, all small cars, they\u2019re going to make them in Mexico.

You look at Ireland being just about the lowest, a little bit lower. So, we\u2019re not the lowest, but we\u2019re getting down there.

They do of all sorts of things, and they get it back on track one way or the other. And I\u2019ve had friends come to me that have been devastated. People that are manufacturers, that are great manufacturers, very successful people, but they\u2019ve become less and less successful because they can\u2019t beat the system. And in this way, too, it\u2019s a rigged system. And they\u2019re almost doing well and then, boom, there\u2019s a massive devaluation in China or other countries. And there are plenty of other countries out there. Some are actually hurting China now. But the fact is that when they have 7% and you see it where they start dropping 7% or 8%, they consider that to be a disaster. And yet we\u2019re stuck at 1%. Probably the real number is 1% but certainly no more than 2%, and we try and learn to live with it. We can\u2019t do that anymore. So we\u2019re going to unleash a tremendous opportunity that we\u2019re bringing back the trillions of dollars that doesn\u2019t come into this country.

I\u2019ll tell you the thing that most surprised me in going around, because I\u2019ve been to, I mean, I\u2019ve been everywhere. I have been working. This started on June 16th. Who knew this was going to happen, right? But it started on June 16 and it\u2019s been an amazing thing. But what truly amazed me from a business standpoint. I speak to big businesses. The biggest businesses in the world. But I also speak to the small business people and the farmers. If they had their choice between this massive tax cut from 35% down to 15% or regulation relief, they would take almost 100% of the time regulation relief. The regulations are a disaster. They\u2019re killing people. They\u2019re killing the farmers. They\u2019re killing the energy folks. They\u2019ve killed the mines. And you know we all believe there\u2019s to be regulation for safety, for environment, for certain reasons. But it is gone so crazy and it\u2019s gotten excessive, but they would take that over taxes. So, we\u2019re going to unleash a tremendous number of jobs coming in. Plus, we\u2019re going to have great cutting. Waste, fraud, abuse. But think of that word \u201cwaste.\u201d I mean, with the Penny Plan. Just a penny out of every dollar. Now, I know you can do that very easily. But we have to appoint to head these massive massive agencies you know, if they were companies they\u2019d be, rather large companies, they\u2019d be up there with the biggest . Some would be bigger than any of the other companies. But you take a penny, a penny, off the dollar and you do that for a number of years and all of sudden really great things start to happen. In addition to that, we spend a tremendous amount on military, which we\u2019re going to increase. We have no choice. But we also defend other countries. And those countries are not paying us nearly what they should be paying us. We\u2019re losing tremendous, billions and billions of dollars on defending other people. Some of whom don\u2019t even appreciate the fact that we\u2019re defending them. And many of them don\u2019t pay us. They don\u2019t pay us. They don\u2019t pay us. I say why because you know, they don\u2019t ask. We don\u2019t ask. So, those countries I\u2019m sure will start to pay for the defense, but it\u2019s a fantastic, it\u2019s a fantastic number. It\u2019s a very, very large, it\u2019s a shocking number. It\u2019s a shocking number. I will just finish with saying this. I have great respect for Japan. But as you know, we defend Japan. We defend Germany. We defend Saudi Arabia. We defend South Korea. We have 28,000 soldiers right now South Korea. These are economic behemoths. Behemoths. These are wealthy countries and when I said they have to pay more, a general came to refute my statement and said, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Mr. Trump know that Japan pays 50% of the cost of its defense?\u201d And I said, \u201cAh, why don\u2019t they pay 100%?\u201d The numbers you\u2019re talking about are massive, and when you add it all together, a lot of good things are going to happen.

According to the Institute for American Energy Resources, this will increase the GDP by more than $100 billion annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next seven years, increase federal, state and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over four decades, increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over a 40-year period. In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects which are desperately needed, including the billions of dollars and projects held up by President Obama. Currently be held up. They just won\u2019t approve it anything. Creating countless more jobs in the process. Finally comes trade \u2013 the foundation for everything. America\u2019s annual trade deficit with the world is now almost $800 billion dollars a year. Who\u2019s negotiating these deals? Anybody in this room negotiating these wonderful deals? Think of it, we have a trade deficit of almost $800 billion a year. That\u2019s going to change so fast. Between World War I and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China join the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2%. Predatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation, which is a big one, and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions of dollars and wealth right out of our country. Right out of our country. So sad that we allow this to happen. Our incompetent politicians were not watching. And, the ones that were watching were taken care of in some form because this should have never been allowed to have happened. It is no great secret that many of the special interest funding my opponent\u2019s campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. They are terrible. They\u2019re terrible for everybody. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, another disaster, and now, the Transpacific Partnership that they\u2019re pushing so strongly. The verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media raced, and they just raced to comment and raced to get comment from, have been proven wrong over such a long period of time. Every, single deal they\u2019ve promoted, every lie, and every prediction has crashed. They just crashed. They\u2019ve been so absolutely wrong and they\u2019ve been so bad for our country. Our manufacturing base has crumbled. Communities have been hollowed out. Wages have declined and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000. I\u2019ve proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. We need our wealth back. We don\u2019t have wealth. We are a debtor nation. This includes the following steps. I\u2019m going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements that a foreign country is using to harm our country and our workers. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. They\u2019re being harmed. And our country is being harmed. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators. And, I will tell you, some of them are in this room right now. Not all of them, but some. And, I know who you are.

An explosion of new businesses and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch. You watch and it\u2019ll happen. We will also allow United States-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment. Big, big deal. On top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth, and this is wealth that\u2019s parked overseas. Nobody knows how much it is. They say it\u2019s $2.5 trillion \u2013 I have people that think it\u2019s $5 trillion. We\u2019ll bring them back and it\u2019ll be taxed only at the rate of 10% instead of 35%. And who would bring it back at thirty-five percent? Obviously nobody because nobody\u2019s doing it. I think it\u2019s going to be something that will be so phenomenal \u2013 far beyond what people even think. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come roaring back into our country and lots of good things will start to happen. We will turn America into a new magnet for new jobs, and that means jobs in our poorest communities. So important. And right now, we have companies leaving the country because taxes are too high, but we actually have companies leaving the country to get their money, and that\u2019s a first. Nobody\u2019s ever heard of that one before, but believe me, that\u2019s happened. Next comes regulations. One of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by out of control bureaucrats. Regulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry, and the regulations industry is one business I will absolutely put to an end day one. In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations \u2013 up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, over-regulation costs our economy $2 trillion a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000. I propose a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety. And I will eliminate all needless and job killing regulations now on the books and there are plenty of them. This includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations like the Waters of the U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA\u2019s so-called Clean Power Plan, which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plants. I mean, all over the country they\u2019re shutting down. Remember what Hillary Clinton said. She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills and shut down the steel workers, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen. We\u2019re going to put our great miners and our steel workers back to work. Energy reform is central to our plan as well. According to Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama\u2019s energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion and reduce incomes by $7,000 per person. And today you have workers, and I see them all the time and I meet them all the time, and they\u2019re part of this massive group of people that have just come onto this movement. But you have workers making less money today than they made 18 years ago in real wages. They\u2019re working much harder, oftentimes because of the disastrous Obamacare that we\u2019re going to repeal and replace. Oftentimes, they\u2019re working two jobs. So, they\u2019re working harder, they\u2019re older, and they\u2019re making less. Like me, I\u2019m working harder than I\u2019ve ever worked also. But, these are minor \u2013 nobody cares about that, that\u2019s okay. Who cares about that?! ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s economic speech \u2013 Part 5"}, {"text": "It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate its first $10 trillion in debt. It took President Obama less than eight years to add another $10 trillion. Now it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, our infrastructure but that didn\u2019t happen. Instead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military. Greatest people on Earth and they have a badly depleted military. Its equipment \u2013 old and tired. And another 14 million people who have left the workforce. Never has so much money been spent so poorly and so unwisely. But we\u2019re going to turn that all around and here\u2019s how. It begins with bold, new tax reform. Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re going down, not up, they\u2019re going down. Think you were concerned they\u2019re going up. As outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets, from seven to three. The new brackets will be 12%, 25% and 33% but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all. In fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax world entirely so that all of that work that we do in Washington can be discontinued. They\u2019ll pay tax, but they\u2019ll pay tax when they start making a certain amount of income. By lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions and millions of new jobs. In addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and close special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle-class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit and it won\u2019t even be close. They have been forgotten. We are not going to forget them. They have built our country. We will not forget. This is a working\u2026thank you. This is a working and middle-class tax relief proposal. The tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my child care proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka. These proposals are central and a very, very powerful central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan. Families will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will be disproportionately and it will benefit working and middle-class families. Gotta take care of our middle-class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation. Parents will also be able to enroll a tax-free, dependent care saving account for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an expanded earned income tax credit in the form of child care rebates and a matching $500 contribution for their saving account. A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill. That\u2019s a tremendous saving and they\u2019ll have a better life. A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill from what they\u2019re paying right now. By contrast, someone earning $5 million, like the people in this room, will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all. One of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate, down from the current 35% rate.

They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future. These are the forgotten men and women of our country and they have been forgotten. People who work hard but don\u2019t have a voice. I\u2019m running to be their voice and to fight and bring prosperity to every part of this country. Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it\u2019s their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any consideration, before anything. We have to do that. I\u2019m not running to be the president of the world. I\u2019m running to be president of the United States of America. And as your president, I will fight for every last American job and every American company, which really a lot of companies in this room I can tell you. We\u2019re going to be fighting for you because you\u2019re bringing the jobs. We\u2019re a nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal and won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon. It\u2019s time to start thinking big once again. That\u2019s why I believe it\u2019s time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth. And my great economists don\u2019t want me to say this but I think we can do better than that. Now, they\u2019re upset. They\u2019ll be very upset. But I think we can do and maybe substantially better than that. In working with my economic team, we\u2019ve put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next 10 years, our economic team estimates that under our plan, the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website. Just look at the math. It works. This growth means that our jobs and plans including our child care reforms that Ivanka Trump, my daughter is so involved in. I like her too. Will be completely paid for in combination with proposed budget savings. It will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit. It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy, and trade policies. Right now, under the Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1% last quarter \u2013 a number that was shocking to people that do this professionally and for life. It translates into millions of lost jobs and certainly millions of lost good jobs because we don\u2019t have good jobs anymore. Those jobs are gone and going. This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Over the last seven years, the economy grew only 2.1% \u2013 the slowest period in 70, 7-0, 70 years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs. Perhaps most shockingly, one in six men aged 18 to 34 are either in jail or out of work. Meanwhile, another two million Hispanic Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty. On top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt.

Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investments. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities. All of these things and so much more are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism which \u2013 it\u2019s just taken so many jobs out of our communities and so much wealth out of our countries. And replace it with a new policy of Americanism. America first, remember that. Under this American system, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: Does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans? It\u2019s a test. If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations \u2013 and we have to do that \u2013 unleash the vast strategy of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America first, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash. America will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest higher, grow, and to create new jobs, new technologies and entire new industries. Instead \u2013 thank you \u2013 instead of driving jobs and welt away, America will become a great magnet for innovation and job creation. My opponent\u2019s plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, and her tax increases are unbelievable. More regulating, more spending, and more wealth re-distribution. A future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity. The only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton are the donors and the special interests but bad for our country. In Hillary Clinton\u2019s America, we have surrendered our status as the world\u2019s great economy. And we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries. We take care of them better than we take care of ourselves. Not one single idea she\u2019s got will create one net American job or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can offer is a welfare check. That\u2019s about it. Our plan will create paychecks, and they\u2019re going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed or under-employed. In the course of this campaign, I\u2019ve traveled all across the country, and I\u2019ve met the most amazing people. Everyday I\u2019ve seen the goodness and character of our country and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances. I have been all over this country, folks, and we have unbelievable people, but they need leadership. The country needs leadership. In many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I\u2019ve visited cities and towns in upstate New York, where half of the jobs have left and moved to Mexico and other countries. The businesses are gone. They\u2019ve been taken away like taking candy from a baby. Politicians have abandoned these places all over the country. And the people who live there, are just there. No hope. Worse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as \u201cdeplorable:\u201d and \u201cirredeemable\u201d, just last week. So how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens \u2013 tremendous, tremendous numbers of them \u2013 beyond redemption?

It\u2019s a great honor to be with you and we had some really incredible things happen today. The polls are coming out. We\u2019re leading in so many polls. I can\u2019t tell you, I don\u2019t where to begin. But that\u2019s a good feeling. I guess, CNN just came out. We\u2019re leading nationwide with CNN. We\u2019re leading in Ohio and we\u2019re leading in, I think, it just came out, we\u2019re leading in North Carolina, Florida. We\u2019re leading and we\u2019re having a lot of fun. We\u2019re having a lot of fun on the campaign and on the trail. I just wanted to say that there\u2019s always a lot of fun when you come up and the people don\u2019t have the teleprompter working but that\u2019s okay. Lucky I brought some notes. But today, I do want to outline a plan for American economic revival, and it\u2019s a bold and ambitious and forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, income and opportunities for the people of our country \u2013 great people of our country \u2013 I will tell you. My plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden and will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams. Right now, 92 million Americans are on the sideline outside of the workforce, and they\u2019re not a part of our economy. It\u2019s a silent nation of jobless Americans. And look no further and I mean, no further. All you have to do is look at Flint, where I spent a lot of time. The city of Flint and what a disaster has taken place. The jobs have been stripped from the community and its infrastructure has totally collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for General Motors. Today, it\u2019s less than $8,000. We have 8,000 people and that\u2019s going down and they\u2019re making very, very little. And people are trying to go down to that $8,000 mark. What we\u2019re doing is, Ford has announced just yesterday, that they\u2019re moving their small car production facilities to Mexico. And I\u2019ve been talking about this a long while and I think that\u2019s maybe one of the reasons that we\u2019re doing so well in Ohio and Michigan and lots of other places where cars and parts are involved. But to think that Ford is moving its small car division is a disgrace. It\u2019s disgraceful. It\u2019s disgraceful that our politicians allow them to get away with it. Really is. It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn\u2019t drink the water in Mexico. Now, cars are made in Mexico and you can\u2019t drink the water in Flint. But we\u2019re going to turn this around. My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving and that our economy can never grow as it did once before. And boy, oh boy, did it used to grow. We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise and that\u2019s all there is really left to divide because frankly, we\u2019re looking at an economy now of no growth and redistribution of wealth. And that\u2019s not going to work. Everything that is broken today can be fixed and every failure can be turned into a truly great success. Just look at the way I just noted into the teleprompter that just went on. Who else could have pulled that off, okay? Who else?

Our debt to you is eternal. Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The National Guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery, and these are serious, serious bad days for our country \u2013 he recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York City. And I was there. I know what you went through. Since 9/11, there have been 780,000 members of the National Guard deployed overseas, including those with multiple deployments. Right now 10,000 members of the National Guard are in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other countries all across the world and doing an unbelievable job. Members of the National Guard come from all walks of life, work in every kind of job imaginable, and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids, serve their states, and answer the call of duty for their country. If I am given the honor to serve as your president, which I think will happen but we\u2019re going soon find out. We hope. And if it does happen, I will pledge to give you the resources, the equipment, and the support you need and deserve and that you\u2019re not getting. You will have a true and loyal friend in the White House. Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion. I will not let you down. I am running to be a president for all Americans, and I\u2019ve been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform. All Americans, you know what I mean. All across this country, I\u2019ve met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve enjoyed more than the time I\u2019ve spent with our service members, police officers, and also our firefighters and paramedics. These are incredible people.

In the 20th century, the United States has defeated Fascism, Nazism, and Communism. Now, a different threat challenges our world \u2013 radical Islamic terrorism. This summer, there has been an ISIS attack launched outside the war zones of the Middle East \u2013 hard to believe \u2013 every 84 hours. Here in America, we have seen one brutal attack after another. 13 were murdered and 38 wounded in the assault on Ft. Hood. The Boston Marathon bombing wounded and maimed 264 people, and ultimately left five dead \u2013 including two of our great police officers. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, five unarmed marines \u2013 unbelievable people by the way \u2013 were shot and killed at a military recruiting center. Last December, 14 innocent Americans were gunned down at an office party in San Bernardino; another 22 were very gravely injured. In June, 49 Americans were executed at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando; another 53 were badly injured. It was the worst mass shooting in our history, and the attack by far the worst on the LGBTQ community. And I\u2019ll tell you what, we can never ever allow this to happen again. In Europe \u2013 thank you \u2013 we have seen the same carnage and bloodshed inflicted upon our closest allies. In January of 2015, a French satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, was attacked for publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. 12 were killed, including two police officers, and 11 were wounded. Two days later, four were murdered in a Jewish delicatessen. In November of 2015, terrorists went on a shooting rampage in Paris that slaughtered 130 people, and wounded another 368 people \u2013 some in very, very, very bad shape today. France is suffering gravely, and the tourism industry is being massively affected in a most negative way. In March of this year, terrorists detonated a bomb in Brussels airport, killing 32 and injuring 340 people. This July, in the south of France, an Islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of mass murder, plowing down and killing 85 men, women and children \u2013 and wounding 308 people. Terrible. Among the dead were two Americans \u2013 a Texas father and his 11-year-old son. A few weeks ago, in Germany, a refugee armed with an axe wounded five people in a gruesome train attack. Only days ago, an ISIS killer invaded a Christian church in Normandy, France, forced an 85-year-old priest to his knees \u2013 a priest who was beloved \u2013 before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things. Overseas, ISIS has carried out an absolute atrocity and one after another. Children slaughtered, girls sold into slavery, men and women burned alive. Crucifixions, beheadings and drownings. Ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution. Holy sites desecrated. Christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination.

We have to explain that it exists and explain the difficulties. We have to have a leader that can do that and we don\u2019t have that now.

That is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a Commission on Radical Islam, which will include reformist voices in the Muslim community who will hopefully work with us. We want to build bridges and erase divisions. The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization. This commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers, federal investigators, and immigration screeners. While I\u2019m at it, we should give a hand to our great police officers and law enforcement officials. We will also keep open Guantanamo Bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence. Drone strikes will remain part of our strategy, but we will also seek to capture high-value targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations. Foreign combatants will be tried in military commissions. Finally, we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends material support to terrorism.

We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year. Beyond that, we admit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions. Hundreds of thousands. If we don\u2019t control the numbers, we can\u2019t perform adequate screening. There is no way it can take place. By contrast, my opponent wants to increase, which is unbelievable no matter who you are, no matter where you come from, wants to increase the flow of Syrian refugees by 550% over what they are now. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term, assuming no cuts to other refugee programs. So it could get worse. This would be additional to all other non-refugee immigration. Unbelievable numbers. Unbelievable numbers. The Subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the costs of health care, welfare, housing, schooling, and all other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Department\u2019s placement figures. Think of this $400 billion. In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be America\u2019s Angela Merkel. And you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany. Crime has risen to levels that no one thought would they would ever ever see. It is a catastrophe. We have enough problems in our country; we don\u2019t need more. Lastly, we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures. Another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored. The 9/11 hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications. Almost every one of them. It said practically in big bold letters, \u201cFRAUD\u201d, and nobody saw it. The Russians warned us about the Boston bombers here on political asylum, and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the FBI. Very sad. The female San Bernardino shooter, on her statements and everything that she said. She was here on a fianc\u00e9 visa, which most people had never heard of, from Saudi Arabia, and she wanted to support very openly jihad online. These are the people we are taking in. A neighbor saw suspicious behavior. Bombs on the floor and other things. But didn\u2019t warn authorities because they said they didn\u2019t want to be accused of racial profiling. Now many are dead and many more are gravely wounded. The shooter in Orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after 9/11. He too was interviewed by the FBI. His father, a native of Afghanistan, supported the oppressive Taliban regime and expressed anti-American views very strongly. And by the way, was just seen sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big fat smile on his face all the way through her speech. He obviously liked what she had to say.

It\u2019s a breeding ground, it\u2019s a terrible, terrible breeding ground. A new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well. The common thread linking the major Islamic terrorist attacks that have recently occurred on our soil \u2013 9/11, the Ft. Hood shooting, the Boston bombing, the San Bernardino attack, the Orlando attack \u2013 is that they have involved immigrants or the children of immigrants. Clearly, new screening procedures are needed. A review by the U.S. Senate Immigration Subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses between 9/11 and 2014, and many more since then. And this year is a record for identification. It\u2019s gotten worse \u2013 far worse. We also know that ISIS recruits refugees after their entrance into the country \u2013 as we have seen with the Somali refugee population in Minnesota. Beyond terrorism, as we have also seen in France, foreign populations have brought their anti-Semitic attitudes with them. In Cologne, Germany on New Year\u2019s Eve, we have seen the reports of sexual violence and assault far greater than anybody knows. Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, extreme views about religion \u2013 such as the death penalty and for those who are involved, the death penalty is very, very common if you don\u2019t have the the faith that they demand you have. A Trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration, and we will be tough and we will be even extreme. We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme, extreme vetting. Our country has enough problems, we don\u2019t need more. These are problems like we\u2019ve never had before. In addition to screening out all members or sympathizers of terrorist groups, we must also screen out any who have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles \u2013 or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law. Those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry and hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country. Only those who we expect to flourish in our country \u2013 and to embrace a tolerant American society \u2013 should be issued visas. To put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism. Not for us, not for us. As soon as I take office, I will ask the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to identify a list of regions where adequate screening cannot take place. There are many such regions. We will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume based on new circumstances or new procedures.

We can use existing UN Security Council resolutions to apply new and even stronger sanctions. Military, cyber, and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle Islamic terrorism. But we must use ideological warfare as well. Very important, and they use it on us better than we have ever even thought of using it on them but that will change. Just as we won the Cold War, in part, by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets, so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam.

Our administration would be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East and will amplify their voices. This includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings, where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings. Over 1,000 Pakistani girls are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year. Recently, a prominent Pakistani social media star was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family. In his confession, the brother took pride in the murder and said: \u201cGirls are born to stay home and follow traditions.\u201d Shockingly, this is a practice that has reached our own shores.

I was saying this constantly and consistently to whoever would listen. I said \u201cKeep the oil, keep the oil, keep the oil. Don\u2019t let somebody else get it.\u201d If they had listened to me then, we would have had the economic benefits of the oil, which I wanted to use to help take care of the wounded soldiers and families of those who died in the war in addition to which thousands of lives would have been saved.

Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven absolute failure. We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive. I was an opponent of the Iraq war from the beginning \u2013 a major difference between me and my opponent. Though I was a private citizen, whose personal opinions on such matters were really not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion. I was against, believe me. Three months before the invasion I said, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, to whom I offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery, that \u201cperhaps we shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet\u201d and that \u201cthe economy is a much bigger problem.\u201d In August of 2004, very early right after the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine in an interview. Here is the quote in full: \u201cLook at the war in Iraq and the mess we\u2019re in. I would never have handled it that way.\u201d This was right after the invasion. \u201cDoes anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country? C\u2019mon.\u201d I then continued,\u201dTwo minutes after we leave, there\u2019s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy, in this case guy, will take over. And he\u2019ll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam Hussein did not have.\u201d \u201cWhat was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention, in all fairness, the other side \u2013 the tremendous damage done. All those Iraqi kids who\u2019ve been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All of this death and destruction for nothing.\u201d So I have been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in. But I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out. After we had made those hard-fought sacrifices and gains, we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal \u2013 on a timetable advertised to our enemies. They said we\u2019re moving out. Here\u2019s our time. Here\u2019s our date. Who would do this but an incompetent president? Al Qaeda in Iraq had been decimated, and Obama and Clinton gave it new life and allowed it to spread all across the world. By that same token, President Obama and Hillary Clinton should never have attempted to build a democracy in Libya, to push for immediate regime change in Syria, or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt. One more point on this: I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq. I said it over and over and over again \u2013 another area where my judgment has been proven correct. I just said it so many times, virtually every time I was interviewed. \u201cKeep the oil, keep the oil.\u201d \u00a0 ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy speech at Youngstown State University \u2013 Part 4"}, {"text": "In short, the Obama-Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East, and put the nation of Iran \u2013 which chants \u201cDeath to America\u201d \u2013 in a dominant position of regional power and, in fact, aspiring to be a dominant world power. It all began in 2009 with what has become known as President Obama\u2019s global \u201cApology Tour\u201d. We all remember. We all remember. In a series of speeches, President Obama described America as \u201carrogant, dismissive, derisive\u201d and a \u201ccolonial power.\u201d He was describing us. He informed other countries that he would be speaking up about America\u2019s \u201cpast errors.\u201d He pledged that we would no longer be a \u201csenior partner\u201d that \u201csought to dictate our terms.\u201d He lectured CIA officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes and described Guantanamo Bay as a \u201crallying cry for our enemies.\u201d Perhaps no speech was more misguided than President Obama\u2019s speech to the Muslim world delivered in Cairo, Egypt, 2009. I remember it well. In winning the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism, and called the USSR the \u201cEvil Empire\u201d. Yet, when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo, no such moral courage could be found or would be found. Instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations, and the systematic violations of human rights, or the financing of global terrorism, President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights record \u2013 and remember this \u2013 our human rights and theirs. The records are unbelievable and unmistakable. His na\u00efve words were followed by even more na\u00efve actions. The failure to establish a new Status of Forces Agreement in Iraq and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS \u2013 without question. The failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clinton\u2019s disaster \u2013 total disaster \u2013 in Libya. President Obama has since said he regrets and really regrets Libya and the mistake he made. He considers it his worst mistake. According to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision, but Hillary Clinton\u2019s forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor. That\u2019s why we went in. With one episode of bad judgment after another, Hillary Clinton\u2019s policies launched ISIS onto the world stage. Yet, as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out really to be not so hot for our world and our country, the Middle East in particular. The Clintons made almost $60 million in gross income while she was Secretary of State. It is unbelievable. Incident after incident proves again and again Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment, as said by Bernie Sanders, stability and temperament, and the moral character to lead our nation. Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS, and all of the many adversaries we face \u2013 not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around.

Anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president. The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton. Let\u2019s look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before the Obama-Clinton administration took over. Libya was stable. Syria was under control. Egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the United States. Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions. Fast-forward to today. What we have \u2013 and think of this \u2013 and the decisions made by Obama-Clinton group have been absolutely disastrous. Libya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other really brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations. Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States. In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world. Iraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose. ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West. In 2014, ISIS was operating in seven nations. They were in seven nations. Terrible, but that\u2019s what it was. Today, they are fully operational in 18 countries with aspiring branches in six more, for a total of 24 \u2013 and many believe that number is actually 28 to 30 countries. They don\u2019t even know. The situation is likely worse than the public has any idea. A new Congressional report reveals that the administration has downplayed the growth of ISIS, with 40% of analysts saying they had experienced efforts to manipulate their findings.

That discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time. Right now, however, we are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis like never before.

We\u2019ve been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They\u2019re decades and decades old. To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They\u2019re archaic. They\u2019re ancient. We wouldn\u2019t put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration? So let\u2019s now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if vigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years.

We\u2019ve had some big waves and tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation. We want to ensure that it works. Assimilation \u2013 an important word. Integration and upward mobility. Within just a few years, immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals to keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms, to select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society, and their ability to be financially self-sufficient.

These 13,000 releases occur on Hillary Clinton\u2019s watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she decided she would not do it. And Arizona knows better than most exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable. The Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30% committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation. We take them. We take them. Number eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, which we need desperately. For years, Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action. Never happens. Never happens.

And I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system. Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never ever left. Why should they? Nobody\u2019s telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want. We\u2019ll take care of you. Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose \u2013 and they really are a big problem \u2013 pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States on expired visas. And you know what that would have meant. What that could have meant. Wouldn\u2019t that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant. Last year alone, nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my administration. If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy \u2013 that\u2019s what it is \u2013 then we have a completely open border and we no longer have a country. We must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced. Number nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet. We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country. Immigration law doesn\u2019t exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life \u2013 the work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else. That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world.

For instance, in the last five years, we\u2019ve admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan and these two countries, according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That\u2019s what they say. That\u2019s what they say \u2013 they\u2019re justified. Right? And we\u2019re admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked about their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities, attitudes on radical Islam, which our president refuses to say, and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully none.

There are at least 23 countries that refused to take their people back after they\u2019ve been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals.

Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities. And by the way, the results are horrific. Horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick\u2019s tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet, despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries, Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And they would comply if we would act properly. In other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don\u2019t. The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place.

As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities but unlike this administration no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement.

Very important to us. I\u2019ve also worked with lawmakers who\u2019ve led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly, I\u2019ve met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important. Number one, are you ready? Are you ready? We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%. They don\u2019t know it yet but they\u2019re going to pay for the wall. And they\u2019re great people and great leaders but they\u2019re going to pay for the wall. On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical tall powerful beautiful southern border wall. We will use the best technology including above and below ground sensors \u2013 that\u2019s the tunnels. Remember that. Above and below. Above and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance, and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels, and keep out criminal cartels. And Mexico, you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us.

To all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate and that issue is the wellbeing of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated. But she\u2019s not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder. No, she\u2019s only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important. We will be fair, just, and compassionate to all. But our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens. Thank you. President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it. President Obama and Hillary Clinton supports sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. They support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous criminals from detention. And they support unconstitutional executive amnesty. Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants breaking the federal budget. On top of that, she promises uncontrolled, low skill immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country, our citizens. Most incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan Horse. Watch what\u2019s going to happen folks. It\u2019s not going to be pretty. This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time.

Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. 90-years-old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long who did not meet Obama administration\u2019s standards for removal and they knew it was going to happen. In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran \u2013 a great woman according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never ever deported despite the fact that everybody wanted him out. A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names. 25,000. On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide one million at risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting. While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn\u2019t change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back and they\u2019re hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances. But these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing \u2013 the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they\u2019re treated better than our vets. Not going to happen anymore, folks. Nov. 8th. Not going to happen anymore.

Thank you. Thank you. Let me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you, the American people. It doesn\u2019t serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens. But if we\u2019re going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people \u2013 our forgotten working people \u2013 have over immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, school, tax bills, and general living conditions. These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it\u2019s just not going to work out. It\u2019s our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us. Then there\u2019s the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people. So many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while, and I look forward to introducing \u2013 these are amazing, amazing people.

The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into the U.S. \u2013 think of it \u2013 into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton.

Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.

I\u2019ve worked alongside him for more than a decade now at the Trump Organization. and I\u2019ve seen how he operates as a leader making important decisions that shape careers and that change lives. I learned a lot about the world from walking construction jobs by his side. When run properly, construction sites are true meritocracies. Competence in the building trades is easy to spot and incompetence is impossible to hide. These sites are also incredible melting pots gathering people from all walks of life and uniting them to work towards a single mission. There have always been men of all background and ethnicities on my father\u2019s job sites, and long before it was commonplace, you also saw women. My father values talent. He recognizes real knowledge and skill when he finds it. He is color blind and gender neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period. Words and promises, no matter how visionary they sound, will only get you so far. In our business, you\u2019re not a builder unless you got a building to show for it or in my father\u2019s case, city skylines. Most people strive their entire lives to achieve great success in a single industry. My father has succeeded in many on the highest level and on a global scale. One of the reasons he has thrived as an entrepreneur is because he listens to everyone. Billionaire executives don\u2019t usually ask the people doing the work for their opinion of the work; my father is an exception. On every one of his projects, you\u2019ll see him talking to the super, the painter, the engineers, the electricians; he\u2019ll ask them for their feedback if they think something should be done differently or could be done better. When Donald Trump is in charge, all that counts is ability, effort and excellence. This has long been the philosophy of the Trump Organization. At my father\u2019s company, there are more female than male executives. Women are paid equally for the work that we do, and when a woman becomes a mother, she is supported not shut out. Women represent 46% of the total U.S. labor force and 40% of American households are female primary breadwinners. In 2014, women made 83 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Single women without children earned 94 cents for each dollar earned by a man whereas married mothers only made 77 cents. As researchers have noted, gender is no longer the factor creating the greatest wage discrepancy in this country \u2013 motherhood is. As president, my father will change the labor laws that were put in a place at a time when women were not a significant portion of the work force, and he will focus on making quality child care affordable and accessible for all. As a mother myself of three young children, I know how hard it is to work while raising a family and I also know that I\u2019m far more fortunate than most. American families need relief. Policies that allow women with children to thrive should not be novelties; they should be the norm. Politicians talk about wage equality but my father has made it a practice at his company throughout his entire career. He will fight for equal pay for equal work and I will fight for this too right alongside of him.

When my father says that he will build a tower, keep an eye on the skyline, floor by floor a soaring structure will appear \u2013 usually record setting in its height and iconic in its design. Real people are hired to do real work. A vision becomes reality. When my father says that he will make America great again, he will deliver. We have a chance this year to reclaim our heritage as a country that dreams big and makes the impossible happen. Fortunately, Donald Trump is incapable of thinking small. When I was a child, my father always told me, \u201cIvanka, if you are going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.\u201d And as president, my father will take on the bold and worthy fights.

For more than a year, Donald Trump has been the people\u2019s champion, and tonight he is the people\u2019s nominee. Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat. More than party affiliation, I vote based on what I believe is right for my family and for my country. Sometimes it\u2019s a tough choice. That is not the case this time.

Real change, the kind we have not seen in decades, is only going to come from outside the system, and it\u2019s only going to come from a man who\u2019s spent his entire life doing what others said could not be done. My father is a fighter. When the primary\u2019s got tough \u2013 and they were tough \u2013 he did what any great leader does \u2013 he dug deeper, worked harder, got better, and became stronger. I have seen him fight for his family. I have seen him fight for his employees. I have seen him fight for his company. And now, I am seeing him fight for our country. It\u2019s been the story of his life, and more recently the spirit of his campaign. It\u2019s also a prelude to reaching the goal that unites us all when this party \u2013 and better still this country \u2013 knows what it is like to win again. If it\u2019s possible to be famous and yet not really well known, that describes the father who raised me. In the same office in Trump Tower, where we now work together, I remember playing on the floor by my father\u2019s desk, constructing miniature buildings with Legos and Erector sets while he did the same with concrete, steel, and glass. My father taught my siblings and me the importance of positive values and a strong ethical compass. He showed us how to be resilient, how to deal with challenges, and how to strive for excellence in all that we do. He taught us that there\u2019s nothing that we cannot accomplish if we marry vision and passion with an enduring work ethic. One of my father\u2019s greatest talents is his ability to see potential in people before they see it in themselves. It was like that for us too growing up. He taught us that potential vanishes into nothing without effort, and that like him, we each had a responsibility to work, not just for ourselves but for the betterment of the world around us. Over the years, on too many occasions to count, I saw my father tear stories out of the newspaper about people whom he had never met, who were facing some injustice or hardship. He\u2019d write a note to his assistant in his signature black felt tip pen and request that the person be found and invited to Trump Tower to meet with him. He would talk to them and then draw upon his extensive network to find them a job or get them a break. And they would leave his office, as people so often do after having been with Donald Trump, feeling that life could be great again. Throughout my entire life, I have witnessed his empathy and generosity towards others, especially those who are suffering. It is just his way of being in your corner when you\u2019re down. My father not only has the strength and ability necessary to be our next president, but also the kindness and compassion that will enable him to be the leader that this country needs.

Back in 1986, the city of New York tried to refurbish a simple ice skating rink in Central Park. The project dragged out for over six years and ballooned to over $13 million, $5 million over an already inflated budget. That\u2019s when my father, who overlooked this disastrous construction site from his office window each and every day, decided he had to step in. Disgusted by government incompetence and ineptitude, he invested $2 million of his own money in order to complete the project.

I see in his eyes the indignity and frustration of a domestic infrastructure back at home that is in complete disarray and no longer on par with so many other developed nations. I see in his eyes the sadness of innocent lives lost like those of Kate Steinle and Jamiel Shaw and so many others cut short by illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities, victims of a revolving door of government ineptitude and corruption that leaves innocent Americans defenseless. I see in his eyes the humiliation of an education system ranked 30th in the world. I see in his eyes disgrace of nearly $400 billion trade imbalance with China, the $60 billion trade imbalance with Mexico, and a continued destabilization of the Middle East, which has cost our nation trillions and trillions of dollars and thousands and thousands of lives. But today, I see in his eyes a man who truly loves his country, who is proud of his country and who wants his country to be great again. I want to thank my father over there for the life that he has provided me, for the life that he has provided my family and the life that he has provided all of our employees around the world. I want to thank my father for the life that he has enabled me to provide to my future children as my beautiful wife, Lara and I start thinking about that amazing chapter of our lives. To that end, I often think about the legacy I wish to leave my children, and to me, there are a few things that I hold closer to my heart than charity.

It is such an honor to be here for a man I love so, so, so, so much. That\u2019s my father. 13 months ago, my father sat my family down and told us the time had come. He could no longer sit idly by and watch our beloved country \u2013 the country that had given our family so much success, so much opportunity -crumble before our very eyes. He confirmed to us that he was prepared to announce his candidacy for President of the Untied States. He made sure to acknowledge that ours would not be an easy path, that we should we should prepare ourselves for what was to come, that we quickly learn who our true friends were. Without hesitation, we each committed our unwavering support. But this time, none of us could have predicted what lay ahead \u2013 the records he would break, the stadiums he would fill, the movement he would start. Today my father stands before you with the most primary votes of any Republican candidate in history of our nation. He shattered voter registration records across the country. He has defied the predictions of every single political pundit and turned traditional debates into must-see TV. He has inspired multiple generations, including my own \u2013 millennials like myself \u2013 who have so little faith in our politicians that they no longer even consider public service to be a noble career. A year ago, my father was a businessman. But like many Americans, he simply could no longer stand to see what was happening to our great country. He could no longer stand to see special interest dollars dictate incompetent foreign policy that puts foreign countries before our very own. He could no longer tolerate an inept administration that considers giving $150 billion to Iran or releasing five radical Islamic terrorists a successful negotiation. He could no longer bear witness to our continued Second Amendment attacks. He could no longer stand to see the word Christmas stripped from public use or the Pledge of Allegiance removed from our schools in an effort to be politically correct. So, my father made the courageous decision to set aside a company to which he\u2019s dedicated his entire life, to set aside a global brand that he has made synonymous with success, with quality, with uncompromising \u2013 just the best. At a time when the people at the pinnacle of their career, like my father, would have held fast to a lifestyle that has truly become the epitome of the American dream, my father instead chose to give that dream back to the people it had eluded for so long. As daunting of a journey as he knew it would be, for him, it was the easiest decision in the world. After all, who better to implement common-sense business approach to this country? Who better to apply practical solutions to the impractical decision making of an administration that has bred a $19 trillion debt, one that goes up by $32,000 dollars a second and over $2 billion a day? Who better to implement common sense tax reductions for one of the highest taxed nations in the world, allowing our citizens a chance to keep more of what they earn as opposed to having it squandered away by our inefficient government? Who better to negotiate the return of countless American manufacturers, like Nabisco and Ford and Carrier and so many others, back to the United States where they began than a man who has single-handedly employed tens and tens and tens of thousands of people around the country?

Calls that pleaded for help. Calls that he and his team tried to answer. But calls that didn\u2019t save all his friends because Secretary Clinton\u2019s State Department had ignored their request for help, both on the night in question and even in the weeks and months leading up to the attack. It was a tragedy and one that would be repeated were she to win the election. Ask Mark, who\u2019s fit to lead? Who has the judgment to lead? Who will take that call at three o\u2019clock in the morning? Or better yet, ask yourselves if you were in Mark\u2019s shoes that night, who would you rather call? Let me tell you something about risk, if Hillary Clinton were elected, she\u2019d be the first president who couldn\u2019t pass a basic background check. It\u2019s incredible. Hillary Clinton is a risk Americans can\u2019t afford to take. She says she\u2019ll issue executive orders to take away Americans\u2019 guns. She wants to appoint judges who will abolish the Second Amendment. Just look at how effective those laws have been in inner city Chicago. A city with the toughest gun laws in our nation, where 70 people were murdered last month alone and where over 3,400 American lives have been lost since this administration took office in 2009. You know why those laws fail? Because criminals by definition don\u2019t follow laws. Rather than prosecuting real criminals, she would strip hard working, law abiding citizens of their rights to protect themselves and their families. She\u2019ll throw every possible obstacle in the path of safe, reliable, affordable, energy, produced in America, by Americans for American businesses and families. Rather than being energy independent, our country will be forced to remain beholden to her buddies in the Middle East. Those are risks we can\u2019t afford to take. And when we win, we\u2019re not going to have to. There\u2019s so much work to do. We will not accept the current state of our country because it\u2019s too hard to change. That\u2019s not the America I know. We\u2019re going to unleash the creative spirit and energy of all Americans. We\u2019re going to make our schools the best in the world for every single American of every single ethnicity and background. We\u2019re going to put Americans first. All Americans. Not a special class of crony elites at the top of the heap. We\u2019re going to elect a president who will work with everyone to pass legislation that will make our country great again. A president who will give us a tax code that will free the American economy and end special loopholes for the wealthy. A president who will give us an immigration law that protects American citizens and gives them jobs. A president who will repeal and replace Obamacare without leaving our most vulnerable citizens without health care and who will do it without destroying Medicare for seniors as Hillary Clinton has proposed. A president who knows we can\u2019t simply delete our problems but that we have to tackle them head on. A president who won\u2019t allow PC culture to put the safety and well-being of our children and our loved ones at stake. A president who won\u2019t bow and pander to nations that shudder at the very thought of America\u2019s existence. A president more concerned with the safety and comfort of his fellow Americans than the feelings of those hostile nations abroad, who if given the option would wipe America off the face of this Earth! A president not beholden to special interests, foreign and domestic, and one who funded his entire primary run out of his own pocket just to prove it. A president who will secure and defend the borders of the United States and will appoint judges who believe that freedom requires a limited government. A president who won\u2019t use the highest office in the land as a path to personal enrichment.

That he would trust his own children\u2019s formative years to these men and women says all you need to know about Donald Trump. We didn\u2019t learn from MBAs. We learned from people who had doctorates in common sense. Guys like Vinny Stellio [sp], who taught us how to drive heavy equipment, operate tractors and chainsaws, who worked his way through the ranks to become a trusted adviser of my father. It\u2019s why we\u2019re the only children of billionaires as comfortable in a D10 Caterpillar as we are in our own cars. My father knew that those were the guys and gals that would teach us the dignity of hard work from a very young age. He knows that at the heart of the American dream is the idea that whoever we are, wherever we\u2019re from, we can get ahead, where everyone can prosper together. The other party also tells us they believe in the American dream. They say we should worry about economic inequality and immobility. You know what? They\u2019re right. But they don\u2019t tell you that it was their policies that caused the problem and it was their policies that have no accountability. They gave us the worst immigration system in the world, one that imports immobility, one that drives down employment and wages for Hispanic Americans, for African Americans, and for everyone. An immigration system that favors illegals over those trying to go through the process legally and, at times, even over law-abiding citizens. It was Bernie Sanders himself who warned that a large tide of new workers keeps wages low and poverty high. The other party gave us public schools that far too often fail our students, especially those who have no options. Growing up, my siblings and I, we were truly fortunate to have choices and options that others don\u2019t have. We want all Americans to have those same opportunities. Our schools used to be an elevator to the middle class, now they\u2019re stalled on the ground floor. They\u2019re like Soviet-era department stores that are run for the benefit of the clerks, and not the customers, for the teachers and the administrators and not the students. You know why other countries do better on K through 12? They let parents choose where to send their own children to school. That\u2019s called competition. It\u2019s called the free market. And it\u2019s what the other party fears. They fear it because they\u2019re more concerned about protecting the jobs of tenured teachers than serving the students in desperate need of a good education. They want to run everything top-down from Washington. They tell us they\u2019re the experts and they know what\u2019s best. The other party gave us a regulatory state on steroids. Dodd-Frank was a thousand pages long and it\u2019s already spun off 22,000 pages in regulations. Imagine trying to digest all that before you even open your doors for business. That doesn\u2019t help consumers. What it does is destroy small business in favor of big businesses who can afford the vast number of lawyers and accountants needed to comply. Dodd-Frank is consumer protection for billionaires. We\u2019ve produced the thickest network of patronage and influence of any country at any time in world history. It\u2019s composed of a self-satisfied people at the top \u2013 our new aristocrats. We can\u2019t live that way any longer, it\u2019s too risky. Let me talk a little bit about risks. The other party is the party of risk. I\u2019ve spent many time with many great Americans who have served this country in the military, and they know what\u2019s at stake. When we have weak leaders in positions of power, Americans risking their lives for our freedoms are less safe. You know, almost daily I get a call or a text from a real American hero.

I\u2019m the husband to Vanessa, an amazing wife and mother. And a son of a great man. I\u2019m an American. And tonight I want to talk to you about the country we live in. The country our children will grow up in. For my generation, this is the most important election of our lifetime \u2013 one that will determine the future of our country and in turn the future of the world. For too long our country has ignored its problems, punting them down the road for its future generations to deal with. In business, I was trained by my father to make the tough investments and decisions today to ensure a brighter future tomorrow. We\u2019ve actually started to believe that solving our great problems is an impossible task. And that\u2019s why we need to elect a man who has a track record of accomplishing the impossible. For the first time, parents no longer think that their kids will be as well off as we were. We\u2019ve lost the confidence in our leaders and the faith in our institutions. We\u2019ll remember one thing. We\u2019re still Americans. We\u2019re still one country, and we\u2019re going to get it all back. We\u2019re going to get it back better than ever before. I know we\u2019ll get it back because I know my father. I know that when people tell him it can\u2019t be done, that guarantees that he gets it done. I know that when someone tells him that something is impossible, that\u2019s what triggers him into action. When people told him that it was impossible for a boy from Queens to go to Manhattan and take on developers in the big city, rather than give up, he changed the skyline of New York. I\u2019ve seen it time and time again. That look in his eyes when someone says it can\u2019t be done. I saw that look a little over a year ago when he was told he couldn\u2019t possibly succeed in politics. Yes, he did. For my father, impossible is just the starting point. That\u2019s how he approaches business projects. That\u2019s how he approaches life. Whether it\u2019s teaching his granddaughter how to swing a golf club or tackling the toughest negotiations, he\u2019s always fully committed. That\u2019s why the person who had never run for office before, stood on the stage 11 months ago, in this very arena, with 16 professional politicians, and this week that same man will stand before you as our party\u2019s nominee for the president of the United States of America! As a proud son and family member, it was one of the great honors of my life to be able to put him over the top in the delegate count earlier today. His unrelenting determination is why he\u2019s going to become our next president. And why I know that when my father says he can fix the country, he means it. You want to know what kind of president he\u2019ll be? Let me tell you how he ran his businesses, and I know because I was there with him, by his side on job sites, in conference rooms from the time I could walk. He didn\u2019t hide out behind some desk in an executive suite. He spent his career with regular Americans. He hung out with the guys on construction sites, pouring sheet rock and pouring concrete and hanging sheet rock. He listened to them and he valued their opinions as much and often more than the guys from Harvard and Wharton locked away in offices, away from the real work. He\u2019s recognized the talent and the drive that all Americans have. He\u2019s promoted people based on their character, their street smarts, and their work ethic, not simply paper credentials. To this day, many of the top executives in our company are individuals that started out in positions that were blue collar. But he saw something in them and he pushed them to succeed. The true gift as a leader is that he sees the potential in people that they don\u2019t even see in themselves \u2013 the potential that other executives would overlook because their resumes don\u2019t include the names of fancy colleges and degrees.

Please excuse me if I\u2019m a little nervous. When I graduated college a couple of months ago, I never expected to be here tonight addressing the nation. I\u2019ve given a few speeches in front of classrooms of students, but never in an arena with more than 10 million people watching. But, like my father, I never back down from challenges. So, here I am, a little new to the convention scene but incredibly honored and very confident in the good man that America\u2019s coming to know. It\u2019s often said that with enough effort and determination you can do whatever you put your mind to. But, saying those words and living them are different things, and my father has lived them. It\u2019s one of his defining qualities, and I\u2019ve seen it in action all of my life. Whatever he does, he gives his all and does it well. His desire for excellence is contagious. He possesses a unique gift for bringing that trait out in others, starting with those closest to him. He\u2019s always helped me be the best version of myself by encouragement and by example. He motivates me to work my hardest and to always stay true to who I am and what I believe. That\u2019s what he does. He draws out the talent and drive in people so that they can achieve their full potential. That\u2019s a great quality to have in a father, and better yet, in the president of the United States. As a recent college graduate, many of my accomplishments are still to come. But, my dad takes such pride in all that I\u2019ve done so far, no matter how big or how small. I still keep all of my report cards, some dating back to kindergarten, because I like to look back and see the sweet notes that he wrote on each and every one of them. Contrary to what you might expect from someone who places an emphasis on results, my dad\u2019s comments referred often to the sentiments expressed by my teachers about how I acted in and out of the classroom, just not even focusing on the letter grades themselves. Donald Trump has never done anything halfway, least of all as a parent. My father always asks about my family in Georgia to make sure that they are healthy and safe. My uncle served in Vietnam and my 97-year-old great grandfather served in World War II. I believe the measure of a person is revealed in their darkest times. For me, the measure of a parent is based on how they support and bolster you when you\u2019re down. A few years ago, someone very dear to me passed away, and the first call I got \u2013 as I knew I would \u2013 came from my father. Without his unwavering support and care for me during such a challenging time, I don\u2019t know how I would have made it through. As far too many know, it is the small loving acts that help an enormous amount in times of grief. My father is good with advice, as you might guess. But he keeps it short, and the takeaway is usually the same \u2013 to help us find our own way and our own gifts. If you do what you love, hold nothing back, and never let fear of failure get in the way, then you\u2019ve pretty much figured out the Trump formula. My dad is a natural-born encourager \u2013 the last person that will ever tell you to lower your sights, or give up your dream. I always look forward to introducing him to my friends, especially the ones with preconceived notions, because they meet a man with natural charm and no facade. In person, my father is so friendly, so considerate, so funny, and so real. My friends walk away with a glimpse of all that he is and all that he means to me; of the strong, protective, kind, endearing man I am so proud to call my father. I never pictured myself saying all of this to a packed arena, but I\u2019m grateful and fortunate for the chance. I have admired my father all of my life and I love him with all my heart.

He also knows how to remain focused on improving our country \u2014 on keeping it safe and secure. He\u2019s tough when he has to be but he\u2019s also kind and fair and caring.

Our country is underperforming and needs new leadership. Leadership is also what the world needs. Donald wants our country to move forward in the most positive of ways. Everyone wants change. Donald is the only one that can deliver it. We should not be satisfied with stagnation. Donald wants prosperity for all Americans.

I was born in Slovenia, a small, beautiful, and then-Communist country in Central Europe. My sister Ines, who is an incredible woman and a friend, and I were raised my wonderful parents. My elegant and hard-working mother Amalija introduced me to fashion and beauty. My father Viktor installed in me a passion for business and travel. Their integrity, compassion, and intelligence reflects to this day on me and for my love of family and America. From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say and keep your promise, that you treat people with respect. They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily life. That is the lesson that I continue to pass along to our son. And we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them. I\u2019m fortunate for my heritage but also for where it brought me today. I traveled the world while working hard in the incredible arena of fashion. After living and working in Milan and Paris, I arrived in New York City 20 years ago and I saw both the joys and hardships of daily life.

I had to give it up because you\u2019re not allowed to do this, you know, with the equal time laws and provisions. You\u2019re not allowed to do it. I\u2019ve lost certain things, especially early on. You know, early on, I lost Macy\u2019s and I\u2019m glad to see Macy\u2019s stock tanked because they were very disloyal. But just over the subject of illegal immigration, I lost Macy\u2019s as a vendor for ties and shirts and things. It was not a big deal but it was still a loss. No, this is not for brand. If I wanted to do good for my brand, I wouldn\u2019t have done this because, you know, when you \u2013 one thing about politics \u2013 everybody like me. But once you run for politics, you\u2019ll have 55 for you and 45 against. I\u2019ve never had that before. It\u2019s very interesting. My wife said to me, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never heard this before. There were some crowds \u2013 some of the crowds were a little hostile.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019ve been with you for many years and the crowds always loved you. And now you have half the crowd hostile and half the crowd loves you.\u201d And that\u2019s called politics. You know, if you run for office and you get 55% of the vote, that\u2019s considered like a landslide. That\u2019s a big, big difference. But that means that 45% of the people don\u2019t like you. So for my brand, this has not been a good thing. Although I mean, look where we\u2019ve come. We started out \u2013 we were one in 17 and you know we won. We won.

It\u2019s amazing the way the world is not so different. We\u2019re on the other side of the ocean, but the world is not so different. We\u2019re right over there you go many, many miles right in that direction and to be honest with you, I think a lot of it has to do with immigration. But I also think a lot of it has to do with the fact that they wanted to be independent. They get tired of seeing stupid decisions just like the American people are tired of seeing stupid decisions, whether it\u2019s the Iran deal, whether it\u2019s the border where people just flow across the border like Swiss cheese. They\u2019re tired of seeing stupid decisions made. They\u2019re tired of looking at horrible trade deals. And you have bad trade deals here too. And so I think that has a lot to do with it. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And no, they love what we\u2019ve done here. You know, this is a little bit of what we\u2019re going to do to the United States. You know, the United States has rotted infrastructure. We have roads that are crumbling. I have a friend who\u2019s a trucker. A big trucker. One of the biggest in the world actually. And he said he buy these brand new magnificent trucks. They cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and he\u2019s never had this problem before. They\u2019re just getting destroyed because the highways are loaded with potholes. And when you have an 18-wheeler or a 16-wheeler and you have these big massive trucks and they\u2019re going down a highway at 65 miles an hour and they hit a pothole and they\u2019re loaded up with tons of stuff, he said those trucks, no matter how good they are, they get wiped out. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to our country. And I think this is sort of a mini example of what we\u2019ve done here \u2013 the members love us. Scotland loves us for what we\u2019ve done. The council \u2013 our council member here\u2026The council has been so incredible and you know it\u2019s just been a big love fest. What we do is the United States needs its infrastructure fixed. You know, the bridges are a disaster. The roads are a disaster. My friend told me, he said, he\u2019s never had a problem like this before. He said you go down the highway and a brand new truck that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars is virtually destroyed. They have to bring it back and have it re-hauled because they\u2019re hitting potholes all over the place on highways. Our infrastructure is crumbling in the United States, and we\u2019ve spent probably if you added up now $4 trillion \u2013 maybe more than that \u2013 in the Middle East and we have a problem.

I would give him a hard time. Right? He did a beyond job. Beyond. This is phenomenal\u2026 But no, I will absolutely cut ties. You know, the rules are nobody knows. Okay? It\u2019s never had where somebody has this big a business and runs for president and wins. If I win, I would \u2013 even though I don\u2019t have to do that \u2013 I would probably put everything in trust. My children will run it along with my executives. It\u2019s a big company. My children will run it along with my executives and just do a good job running it. Let me tell you, the importance of the opportunity that I may be given is so important and so massive \u2013 making great trade deals with China and with you folks by the way \u2013 but with China, the numbers are so staggering when you look at trade deficits of $400 billion and $500 billion a year. The numbers are so staggering and so incredible, I wouldn\u2019t even be thinking about the business. I mean, who cares? I mean, I would actually say, \u201cWho cares?\u201d No, I would absolutely \u2013 you don\u2019t have to do this but I would most likely just put it in a blind trust and they would run it or something. Question:\n[On why Trump continues holding campaign events at Trump properties]\n And the other thing is why should I use somebody else\u2019s properties? Number one, it\u2019s not as good. And number two, you know, it\u2019s one of those things. Now, I wish frankly that I wasn\u2019t forced by law to pay myself back. We\u2019re forced to pay. You do understand that? Because a couple of people said he\u2019s paying to his campaign. I\u2019m not paying to my campaign. I would love to give everything for nothing. But by law, I\u2019m forced \u2013 whatever the fair market value of a ballroom is or whatever it may be that we use or an airplane as an example. If I use an airplane, by law, I have to pay it back. And that\u2019s what I do and that\u2019s reflected in the filings. Question:\n[On criticizing Obama]\n I mean, he\u2019s constantly dictating to the world what they should do. The world doesn\u2019t listen to him obviously. You can see that by the vote. But he\u2019s constantly dictating to other countries. So certainly, it doesn\u2019t stop at the water\u2019s edge with him. And you know, very importantly he got it totally wrong. And he\u2019s embarrassed. I mean, he\u2019s embarrassed by the Supreme Court decision yesterday, which was a real rebuke. And he\u2019s very embarrassed by he got involved. I don\u2019t know if that was through a friendship with David Cameron. It could have been, and I understand friendship, and I can understand why he did it. I can understand that. But I think it\u2019s something he shouldn\u2019t have done. It\u2019s not his country. It\u2019s not his part of the world. He shouldn\u2019t have done it and I actually think that his recommendation perhaps caused it to fail.

Question:\n[On Obama and Clinton\u2019s encouragement of UK voters to vote Remain]\n But I was actually very surprised that President Obama would have come over here and he would have been so bold as to tell the people over here what to do. And I think that a lot of people don\u2019t like him and a lot of people voted. If he had not said it, I think your result might have been different. But when he said it, people were not happy about it and I thought it was totally inappropriate. And when I said what I said, I told people, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t do what I\u2019m saying necessarily. Do whatever you think but this was just my opinion.\u201d He came in and really tried to convince people to stay, and I thought it was inappropriate.

Question:\n[On whether Trump would support Boris Johnson as prime minister]\n Question:\n[On campaign shake-up]\n You know, I say this to all the folks here that don\u2019t come from the United States I ran a campaign in the primaries where we got the largest number of votes in the history of the Republican Party primary votes. So, larger than Ronald Reagan, larger than Richard Nixon, larger than Dwight D. Eisenhower who helped win the Second World War. And we ran a very lean campaign and I had fewer people and I spent less money and I funded the money myself. I spent $55 million, I think\u2026 And by the way, I\u2019m forced \u2013 you know, legally, I have to pay myself back. In other words, if I use \u2013 this has nothing to do with the campaign. And you won\u2019t see this. This is to support my children. But if I use one of my resorts in the United States and we have a press conference or something, by law I have to pay myself back. I would like not to. I\u2019d like to just say use the ballroom and let\u2019s not bother with it because a couple of people say I pay. By law you have to pay yourself back. I think that we should have been given credit for, in addition to winning, for winning with less money spent and with a smaller staff. So now we have a staff of 73 people. And Hillary has a staff of 900 people. I won and she won. I don\u2019t think that \u2013 I mean, honestly, as a businessman, I say, \u201cWow, he won with spending less money and a smaller staff.\u201d See, I\u2019d view that as an advantage. A lot of the pundits say, \u201cShe has a much bigger staff.\u201d Well, I think we\u2019re very nimble. I think we\u2019re very nimble. I think we\u2019re doing well. And you\u2019ve seen the polls that are coming in. They\u2019re very close and very equal. We just had one coming out, I think, from West Virginia where I have a 25 point lead. And North Carolina came out yesterday, we have a 2 point lead. Ohio\u2019s even. Pennsylvania\u2019s even. The national polls, we\u2019re getting very close. And I\u2019m spending much less money. She\u2019s spending tremendous amounts of money. We haven\u2019t even started yet. So it\u2019s going to be very interesting because she\u2019s spent \u2013 what was it? $28 million? I mean, she\u2019s spent a lot of money and we\u2019re even. And I think that\u2019s a good sign and I think that\u2019s a good sign. When I won New Hampshire, I spent a tiny fraction of what other candidates spent \u2013 one in particular. I won New Hampshire by a landslide. That person came in seventh. I think, you know, when you can do it on a smaller budget and with fewer people, that\u2019s the kind of person they want to be the president because to me that\u2019s a big thing.

It\u2019s something I\u2019ve never done. I\u2019ve always contributed money to lots of people. A lot of campaign contributions over the years. And once I ran, I became like an outsider. But no, I don\u2019t like doing that but I have done it and we\u2019ve had amazing weeks. Last week, we were in Houston. As you know, we had tremendous lines. I made a speech also and the lines were \u2013 actually on ABC they reported \u2013 ABC local \u2013 they followed the lines all the way to the highways. It was \u2013 actually I\u2019ve never seen anything like that, and then Dallas where we had a similar thing. But we also had fundraisers, and I\u2019ve really never done. You know, I sit with 20 people and we talk and they all hand you checks \u2013 bing, bing, bing, bing. And they\u2019re checks to the RNC and the Republican Party and I feel like I have an obligation to do that. And Tom, the numbers are going to be, I think, quite staggering, especially in July\u2026Don\u2019t forget, we just sort of started this process a few weeks ago and the first filing was for a very limited period of time and it was almost before we started. But the numbers are amazing. Actually, the numbers for the small donations \u2013 we\u2019ve taken a lot of money otherwise \u2013 but the numbers for the small donations are coming in at \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s beyond anything that we thought.

This fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency. We can\u2019t hand over our government to someone who\u2019s deepest darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. Can\u2019t do it. National security is also immigration security and Hillary wants neither. Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States. She\u2019s pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders for the United States. And by the way, 16,500 Border Patrol agents have endorsed Donald Trump \u2013 the first time in the history that they\u2019ve endorsed a presidential candidate. The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They\u2019re also the ones she will hurt the most by far. Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Marianne [sp] Mendoza. She lost her amazing son, Police Sgt. Brandon [sp] Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigration because of open borders and policies supported by Hillary Clinton. Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate. Here\u2019s an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza\u2019s letter: \u201cHillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she\u2019s willing to put each and everyone of our lives in harm\u2019s way \u2013 an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I. She\u2019s only concerned about the power of the presidency and the power that it would bring. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes that she\u2019s already committed against our country.\u201d That\u2019s from Mrs. Mendoza. Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to settle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States on top of the current record level of immigration that we already have. For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America. Hillary\u2019s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor and unemployed Americans totally out of work. She can\u2019t claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage earners to compete against them and win against them because the system is rigged against our people. Here are a few things a Trump administration will do for the Americans and for the American people but for our country. Number one, the first 100 days I will appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution of the United States. Hillary Clinton\u2019s radical judges will virtually abolish the Second Amendment. Can\u2019t let that happen. I will change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good \u2013 really good paying jobs. We don\u2019t have good jobs anymore. These will be good-paying jobs. We\u2019ll stand up to countries that cheat on trade of which there are many. We\u2019ll cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas everywhere else but our country.

I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people. Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department. Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States. Here is some of what we really learned from the book in addition to what we\u2019ve already discussed. A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash; the telecom company escaped all sanctions. Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America\u2019s uranium holdings while non-investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. $145 million. Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access even though he had no national security credentials, although he did make a very large campaign contribution. Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive sharia law, including the punishment by death and stoning if you happen to be gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. Hillary Clinton\u2019s book \u2013 and just think of this. The book talks about it but Hillary took $25 million from Saudi Arabia and much more from others where being gay is also punishable by death. Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and many other countries that horribly abused women and the LGBT citizens. To cover up her corrupt dealings, Hillary illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server. She\u2019s under investigation but it seems like nothing is going to happen even though other people who have done similar things but at a much lower level their lives have been destroyed. It\u2019s a rigged system, folks. It\u2019s a rigged system. Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments, perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China. Sure they have it. Putting all of America and our citizens in danger \u2013 great danger. Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted. While we may not know what\u2019s in those deleted emails, our enemies probably know every single one of them.

She lied to my face, and you know this person cannot be president. She cannot be president.\u201d In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world. Libya was cooperating. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence, believe it or not. Syria was under control. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel \u2013 something very nice because by the way, Israel has been totally mistreated by the United States. ISIS wasn\u2019t even on the map. Fast-forward to 2013. In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed to almost singlehandedly destabilize the entire Middle East. Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to ISIS, the barbarians. Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons. Hillary Clinton\u2019s support for a violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West. She helped force out a friendly regime in Europe and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has re-taken control but Clinton has opened the pandora\u2019s box of radical Islam. Then there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS and the ISIS killers. ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama. ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims throughout the Middle East and peaceful Muslims across the world who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety. In short, Hillary Clinton\u2019s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another. One by one, they\u2019re all bad. She\u2019s virtually done nothing right. She\u2019s virtually done nothing good. It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the war in Iraq in the first place. Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war and, yes, even before the war ever started. But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq because when she got into power she couldn\u2019t wait to rush us off to war in Libya. She lacks the temperament and the judgment and the competence to lead our country. She should not be president under any circumstances. In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office \u2013 somebody that saw her a lot and knows her probably better than almost anybody \u2013 \u201cShe simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office.\u201d From the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true. Her leadership style \u2013 volcanic, impulsive, disdainful and disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasn\u2019t changed one bit. Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by radical Islam. In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States and that\u2019s an increase over President Obama\u2019s already high number. Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth with no way to screen who they are, what they are, what they believe, where they come from. Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the United States.

She gets rich making you poor. Here is a quote from the book: \u201cAt the center of U.S. policy towards China was Hillary Clinton. At this critical time, for U.S.-China relations Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters. These funds were paid to the Clinton\u2019s bank account directly while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.\u201d Tell me, folks, does that work? She sold out our workers and our country for Beijing. Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas and give up congressional power to an international foreign commission. Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she\u2019s pretending that she\u2019s against it. She\u2019s given and deleted as you know \u2013 most people have heard about this. Have we ever heard about her deleting anything? No, I don\u2019t think so. She deleted the entire record from her book and deletion is something she really does know something about because she\u2019s deleted at least 30,000 emails, which by the way, should be able to be found. Should be able to be found because the government, I will say, I\u2019ve always heard you can never really delete an email. So it should be able to be found if they really want to find them but I don\u2019t think they want to find them. This is the latest Clinton cover-up and it doesn\u2019t change anything. If she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this and just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade on every single stage of her career and it will be even worse than the Clintons\u2019 NAFTA deal, and I never thought it would get worse than that. We will lose jobs. We will lose employment. We will loses taxes\u2026everything. We will lose our country. I want trade deals but they have to be great for the United States and for our workers. We don\u2019t make great deals anymore but we will once I become president. I promise you that. It\u2019s not just our economy that\u2019s been corrupted but our foreign policy too. The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions and trillions of dollars and unleashed ISIS across the world. No Secretary of State has been more wrong more often and in more places than Hillary Clinton. Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. Among the victims of our late ambassador Chris Stevens. I mean, she \u2013 what she did with him was absolutely horrible. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed. That\u2019s right. When the phone rang as per the commercial at 3 a.m. Hillary Clinton was sleeping. Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds and hundreds of requests for security. They were desperate. They needed help. Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department refused them all. She started the war that put them in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die. To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about the videos being the cause of death.

Those are the stakes. Hillary Clinton wants to be president but she doesn\u2019t have the temperament or as Bernie Sanders says very strongly the judgment to be president. She does not have the judgment. She believes she\u2019s entitled to the office. Her campaign slogan is \u201cI\u2019m with her.\u201d You know what my response is to that? I\u2019m with you \u2013 the American people. Thank you very much. She thinks it\u2019s all about her. I know it\u2019s all about you. I know it\u2019s all about making America great again for all Americans \u2013 all Americans. Our country lost its way when it stopped putting the American people really first. We have to go back to putting our American people first.

We reward companies for off-shoring and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed. They get punished. This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats. This is a wave of globalism that wipes our middle class and our jobs along with it. We need reform and we have to reform our economic system so that once again we can all succeed together and America can become rich again. We have to make America rich again. And that\u2019s what I mean by America First. Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to the shores. I mean, we have to bring our manufacturers back to the United States. Desperately need it. Desperately we need those jobs. And we need it even from our psyche. One of the really great things and one of the first major bills that George Washington was \u2013 amazing when I saw this for the first time \u2013 the encouragement and protection of manufacturing in America. Our first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying \u201cThe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\u201d In other words, we have to protect our country. I have decided and visited cities and towns across America \u2013 all across America \u2013 and seen the devastations caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton and it\u2019s total devastation \u2013 all over New York, all over Pennsylvania, all over New England, all over the country. Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton\u2019s disastrous \u2013 and totally disastrous \u2013 NAFTA just like she supported China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization. We\u2019ve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed. Among the worst we\u2019ve ever done, among the most destructive agreements we\u2019ve ever signed. Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as Secretary of State \u2013 a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated but rather scorned. Then she left China \u2013 so true. The she left China and what happened is billions and billions of dollars in our intellectual property and China has taken it and it\u2019s a crime which is continuously going on and it\u2019s going on right now.

She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund doing favors oppressive regimes and many others and really many, many others in exchange for cash. Pure and simple, folks.

But the whole point is that we will be much, much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don\u2019t keep on bringing people who add to the problem, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. We\u2019re letting all these people \u2013 hundreds of thousands of people \u2013 and all they\u2019re doing is adding to this incredible problem we have. For instance, the controversial mosque attended by the Boston bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot. This shooter and amazingly in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred? Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women, gays, and anyone else who doesn\u2019t share their views or values. She can\u2019t have it both ways. She can\u2019t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who wants to oppress these same communities. How does this kind of immigration make our lives better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better? Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people in in vast numbers who reject our values? Why? Explain?

And they will have the support that they need to get the job done right, not like it is right now. It\u2019s not right. We also must ensure that the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat. The Senate Committee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since Sept. 11th. Nearly a year ago, the Senate subcommittee asked President Obama\u2019s Department of Justice\u2026and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States. These departments refused to comply. Nobody even knows why they\u2019ve refused to comply. President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since Sept. 11th. So important. The public has a right to know how these people got here, how they came on to this great land. Why are they here? We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs. Very simple. We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country, and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America. Not complicated. And just think of this \u2013 take a look \u2013 every single event even a single individual can be devastating and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in Orlando and what happened in other cases. Just a single event. And just one person. Can you imagine what they\u2019ll do in large groups which we\u2019re allowing now to come here? Truly our president doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s failed and he\u2019s failed us badly. And under his leadership, this situation will not get any better; it will only get worse and I\u2019ve been saying that for a long time. Each year, the United States permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East and many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever growing numbers year after year without any effective plan for our own security. In fact, Clinton\u2019s State Department was in charge of admissions and the admission process for people applying to enter from overseas. Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country.

According to Pew Research, 99% of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive sharia law. We admit many more and that\u2019s just the way it is.

I don\u2019t know if you know this but just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter \u2013 that\u2019s all it was, a slaughter \u2013 Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words radical Islam. Here is what she said \u2013 exact quote \u2013 \u201cMuslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\u201d That is Hillary Clinton. So she says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, and 130 people were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the Second Amendment and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. No good. Not going to happen, folks, not going to happen. Not going to happen. She wants to take away Americans\u2019 guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter. Let them come into the country. We don\u2019t have guns. Let them come in. Let them have all the fun they want. I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror. I will be always defending the Second Amendment. Thank you. Thank you. The bottom line is that Hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical Islam into America and allow it to grow overseas and it is growing. In fact, Hillary Clinton\u2019s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical Islamic immigration into this country threatening not only our society but our entire way of life. When it comes to radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss. It\u2019s deadly. Totally deadly.

Many of the principles of radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions. Remember this, radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay, and anti-American. I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, Jewish people are targets of persecution and intimidation by radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence. This is not just a national security issue; it\u2019s a quality of life issue.

The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since Sept. 11th and the worst mass shooting in our country\u2019s history. So many people \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s just hard to believe. Just so many people dead. So many people gravely injured. So much carnage. Such a disgrace. The horror is beyond description.

They have been through something that nobody could ever experience. This is a very dark moment in America\u2019s history. A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because she wanted to kill Americans but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation. It\u2019s a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation. It\u2019s an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want, and express their identity. It\u2019s an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.

His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime who murders those who don\u2019t share its radical views and they murdered plenty. The father even said he was running for president of Afghanistan. The bottom line is the only reason the killer was in America in the first place is because we allowed his family to come here.

We cannot wait until it\u2019s too late, and I believe my colleagues know it, but have not yet found a way to articulate it. We, as a nation, have to face the ugliness of what he has said and what he is no doubt yet to say. \u00a0We, as a people, must immediately and unconditionally condemn and reject the type of blatant racism we\u2019ve heard in the last few days. Those who do not stand up to intolerance and hatred only encourage it and sow the seeds of bigotry that will ultimately divide us as a nation and a people. \u00a0 I urge all of my Republican colleagues and all Americans to reject the politics of settling scores and grudges and work towards changing the hateful rhetoric we continue to hear. We\u2019re a nation of immigrants, all of us. \u00a0We all know the reality of what it means to work hard to get an education, build a career, find our way to this chamber or to the federal bench.

But they have not gone, in many cases, far enough. \u00a0They have not called him out as they should, politics aside, for the threat he poses to this nation if he is elected. Many of my colleagues must recognize, as I do, that a federal judge born in Indiana, which is part of these great United States, with a Mexican family background, whose parents became U.S. citizens, is not a Mexican judge but an American judge. Just as a United States Senator like this one, born in New York, raised in New Jersey from a Cuban family background, is a United States Senator. \u00a0 And to imply otherwise \u2013 to ask that Judge Curiel recuse himself from a case because of where his parents were born \u2013 is, on its face, racist. They need to come to this floor and denounce the comments of their nominee. \u00a0 In fact, all Americans should denounce this kind of blatant racism, the tone of the Trump campaign, and the slippery slope that his statements, his actions, his demeanor, threaten to send us down. And he doesn\u2019t seem to be able to stop himself. \u00a0He\u2019s doubled-down and said that it\u2019s impossible, for example, that a judge of Muslim descent might not be able to render a favorable decision in a Trump versus Whomever cause because of the candidate\u2019s policy to ban Muslims from entering this country. Anyone who won\u2019t stand up and call this blatant racism has decided to put partisan politics ahead of our country. \u00a0 This is how a new-McCarthyism comes to America, sold by a reality TV show host, aided and abetted by a political party without the courage to stand up to racism in its most cynical form.\n\u2026 ", "name": "Transcript: Sen.

His only response to adversity is to blame someone else and turn people against each other. \u00a0 The fact is leaders don\u2019t turn people against each other; they bring them together in common cause. Mr. Trump needs to learn that there is not always someone else to blame for defeat. \u00a0The fact that you lost doesn\u2019t imply unfairness; it only indicates that you lost.

We have come up. People that you would have never thought possible are now saying, \u201cI support Trump.\u201d So remember that. We don\u2019t talk about that too much. But actually last week, the big story was how fast the Republican Party is healing because it is a healing process. It was a rough \u2013 that was a rough campaign\u2026 I can this. The real is how fast we\u2019re getting together. Now, if I have a Republican who\u2019s not on my side, I\u2019m not going to be \u2013 why should I be particularly nice to that person? I\u2019m not going to go after it like I would Hillary or Crazy Bernie. But you know what? Why should I be nice to that person if I have a person that\u2019s not going to support me? I have no obligation. Politically, I may be right. I may be wrong. But that\u2019s who I am. I\u2019m a very honest person\u2026 If somebody is going to say a little bit negative or a lot negative about me and if they happen to be Republican, I may choose to hit them back. Not always. But I may choose to hit them back. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And if you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal about Mitt Romney, he looks like a fool. Look, I\u2019m not a fan of Mitt Romney. Just so you understand. I raised a lot of money for Mitt Romney. I made robocalls for Mitt Romney. I made speeches for him. He let us down. If you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal this weekend, Mitt Romney looks like a fool. Now, what would I say good about Mitt Romney? Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And by the way, more money is coming in. I wasn\u2019t looking for the credit. But I had no choice but to do this because the press was saying I didn\u2019t raise any money for them. Not only did I raise it, much of it was given a long time ago. And there is a vetting process and I think you understand that. But when I raise almost $6 million and probably in the end will raise more than six because more is going to come in and is coming in. But when I raise $5.6 million as of today, more is coming in. And this is going to phenomenal groups. And I have many of these people vetting the people getting the money and working hard. And then we have to read probably libelous stories or certainly close in the newspapers and the people know the stories are false, I\u2019m going to continue to attack the press. Look, I find the press to be extremely dishonest. I find the political press to be unbelievably dishonest. I will say that. Okay, thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Well, you\u2019ll see it in court documents. But I have a judge who\u2019s very, very unfair. He knows he\u2019s unfair. And I\u2019ll win the Trump University case. I can settle that case. I could have settled it. I just choose not to. In fact, when I ran this, they said why didn\u2019t you settle up that case? I don\u2019t want to settle the case. Because you know what? Because I\u2019m a man of principle. And most of the people that took those courses have letters saying they thought it was great essentially. It was good. It was great. And you know what? When they\u2019re on the stand and you say \u201cHow come you signed the letter saying that Trump University was so good? How come you signed the letter?\u201d The woman that was the original plaintiff in the case \u2013 they went to the court and the judge allowed her to get out of the case. The case should have been dropped. The whole case should have been dropped. They wanted her dismissed from the case. You know why? Because she was deposed, she was such a bad witness that we\u2019d win the case easily. She signed a letter and she\u2019s on film. She\u2019s on tape like these cameras saying unbelievably good things about Trump University. So they didn\u2019t want her anymore because she\u2019s a disaster for them. So they went to the judge and they said \u201cYour honor, we\u2019d like to have her not be a participant, not be a plaintiff in the case.\u201d And he said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s okay.\u201d She\u2019s the one that started the case. Now, they don\u2019t even want her to testify. They don\u2019t want her to testify because she\u2019s a disaster. She has all sorts of beautiful statements about it. And importantly, she\u2019s on tape saying how great it is. They don\u2019t want her. I wouldn\u2019t want her either. Now, I could have settled that case. I could settle that case. I can settle that case. I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019ll go through the process. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n \u2026Here\u2019s what happens. What happens is you will not have \u2013 and very importantly \u2013 you will not have Supreme Court justices. You\u2019re going to lose. You could have as many as four or five. That\u2019s over. Now, [Bill] Kristol\u2019s the one that\u2019s \u2013 but he\u2019s the last one. Don\u2019t forget, he said \u201cTrump will never run.\u201d The guy\u2019s not a smart person. He said, \u201cDonald Trump would never run.\u201d Remember? You remember? I actually blame you. Why do you put this guy on television? I see him on the different shows. He\u2019s got no credibility. Said I won\u2019t run. If I run, I won\u2019t do well. If I do well, this and that. He looks like such a fool. I saw him on one show. He\u2019s practically crying because he can\u2019t justify. Now he comes out with a tweet over the weekend \u2013 over Memorial Day weekend \u2013 it sounds like he\u2019s going to put somebody up. Even I thought it. I thought, \u201cOh, they\u2019re going to find indie.\u201d Now he comes out with something saying he was almost \u2013 almost \u2013 kidding. Okay? Let me tell you, these people are losers. He\u2019s trying to make you \u2013 he\u2019s trying to drive you guys a little bit nuts. If they do an indie, assuming it\u2019s decent, which I don\u2019t think anybody with a reputation would do it because they\u2019d look like fools. But what you\u2019re going to do is you lose the election for the Republicans and therefore you lose the Supreme Court, therefore you will have a group of people put on the Supreme Court where this country will never ever recover. It will never, ever be the same. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Wait, wait, wait. Bill Kristol is a loser. His magazine is failing, as you know. It\u2019s going to be down \u2013 I don\u2019t think it even survives. He\u2019s getting some free publicity. But Bill Kristol \u2013 I\u2019ve been watching this for two years. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t going to run.\u201d Then I go into a race, we go into New Hampshire. \u201cOh, he\u2019s not going to win New Hampshire.\u201d I win in a landslide.

They\u2019re dying while they wait on line. And I am in favor of if they can\u2019t get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time, they\u2019re going to see a doctor and the country\u2019s going to pay for it. They\u2019re going to go to a private doctor or a public hospital and a public doctor but some place that can take them immediately. We\u2019re losing thousands of people waiting on line. And the Veterans Administration is run by Obama just as incompetently as he\u2019s running our country. You look at the TSA, you look at what\u2019s going on at the airports and you look at that. Okay? Just take a look at that. That\u2019s like the Veterans Administration. Nothing in our country works anymore. It\u2019s a mess. And maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing so well in the polls.

And the head of it, [Bob] McDonald said last week that waiting in line is not bad \u2013 look at Disney World. Okay? These are the kind of people we have running things. It\u2019s ridiculous.

I used it for myself, except that I won by such big margins that the whole system is rigged on both sides. With the Republicans it\u2019s less obvious. With Democrats with the whole super delegate thing, it\u2019s ridiculous. So I think that they\u2019re going to have to make that determination. If you\u2019re asking me who I prefer running against?

And again, upstairs I have received phones calls with people crying. I have received letters \u2013 heartfelt letters. \u2026The bad part about the dishonesty of the media is that people like me will be inclined not to do it anymore. Because why should you raise $5.6 million and I think I\u2019ll go over $6 million pretty easily. Nobody said that we started this out as a small little project where it was less than $1 million because it kept just mushrooming and building and building. But nobody talks about that. So we raised $5.6 million. We have so many happy groups. So many happy veterans. And then I see these Hillary Clinton people outside. Now, of course, they don\u2019t know the extent. They probably figured based on reading the press that Trump didn\u2019t make, you know, didn\u2019t raise this kind of money.

You know, Jeff Sessions has never endorsed a presidential candidate before as many years as he\u2019s been in the Senate. So you know, Jeff Sessions is certainly somebody that I would consider. Absolutely. He\u2019s a fantastic person. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n You have a child, a young child, at stake. You know, it\u2019s too bad there wasn\u2019t another way.

First of all for the record, I\u2019m a state representative from New Hampshire, 10 years on the veterans affairs committee, 22 years in the Marine Corps, retired First Sergeant. What I want to clarify here first of all, I would never ever in a million years put my name on a candidate that did not from his heart look me in the eye and tell me he\u2019s concerned about veterans. That\u2019s Donald Trump. I met him over a year ago. I\u2019ve been involved in many fundraisers. There are many scammers out there. He did the right thing by vetting these groups there. If you look at some of the groups, they\u2019re given 20 cents, 40 cents on the dollar and they\u2019re spending the rest for you know their nice lavish trips. He gave 100%. The liberal media is the only ones that have been calling the foundation. All right? I\u2019m a former chairman. I\u2019ve been dealing with this stuff for years as a veterans activist. Stop using veterans as a political pawns. You\u2019ve got a guy outside\u2026go do a Google search on his Facebook. He\u2019s out there. His pictures with Clinton. They are using veterans as political pawns. It must stop. Donald Trump is doing this with a heart. You\u2019re all focused on the way he\u2019s raising money and you\u2019re not looking at the 22 veterans that are killing each other everyday. You\u2019re not concerned about the thousands of veterans that are on waitlists. Look at his plans on his Trump website. He talks about medical cards. He talks about fixing the VA. He talks about competition. I think the liberal media and I\u2019ve been dealing with you a long time. You need to get your head out of your butt. Focus on the real issues. Thank you.

I didn\u2019t want the credit for it but it was very unfair that the press treated us so badly. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And then I see a few guys standing out there. They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re there for. They have no idea. They\u2019re there because Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign sent them.

We had a certain \u2013 same event \u2013 it was roped off where you could only get so many people there and there were a lot of people. I don\u2019t know \u2013 10,000, 15,000, maybe 25,000. I don\u2019t know there was a lot of people. Plus there were people breaking the seams all the way along. Eugene Washington, a man I like actually, wrote an article said there were 5,000 people there. There were many times that. And you weren\u2019t allowed to have any more people.

So a lot of these companies that make a lot of money doing the administration stuff. So no money \u2013 it costs zero dollars to accumulate all of this money. Okay? So you have 22 Kill and that\u2019s $200,000. And you can call these people. That was another thing. A lot of the money when it was sent out, different people would call. I could tell you, I\u2019m not going to mention anybody specifically, but there were a couple of people that were really disgusting. They\u2019d call and these vet groups they don\u2019t get a lot of calls from the press. And maybe some of them would keep quiet or they didn\u2019t know or they didn\u2019t want to talk to the press or they didn\u2019t feel comfortable. So if they didn\u2019t say they got the money, which they all did, 100% got the money. All certified checks. If anyone wants to see the certified checks. But rather than say why don\u2019t you \u2013 could I see a certified check? They said \u201cWell, they didn\u2019t say they got the money.\u201d They all got the money. But they\u2019re not people that always talk to the press. Many of them do talk to the press. Many of them have \u2013 I guess you found $2 million or $2.5 million where they talked. Well, the number is $5.6 million and it\u2019s going to possibly go above that because I believe some other people are coming in. Ready? 22Kill got $200,000. Now, these are checks that have been delivered, that have been cashed, that are now being used to help the vets. Achilles International \u2013 great organization \u2013 $200,000. Much of this money was paid a long time ago. American Hero Adventures \u2013 $100,000. Americans for Equal Living \u2013 $100,000. America\u2019s Vetdogs \u2013 The Veterans\u2019 K-9 Corps Inc. \u2013 $75,000.

We\u2019re going to have an incredible period in Cleveland. We look forward to it. We\u2019ve started working already on the convention. And LeBron, good luck in the series because we\u2019re going to have the series, which of course the longer it goes the less time we have but that\u2019s okay. And it\u2019s going to be very interesting to see what happens. But as you know, they\u2019re playing the basketball championships partially in that arena so I think it will be very exciting. It\u2019ll add to the excitement in Cleveland and that\u2019s good. That\u2019s what we want because it\u2019s going to be an exciting period of time. We have \u2013 we\u2019ve done some awfully good work. I was just informed\u2026that we\u2019ve got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican primaries and we still have I guess six or seven locations to go, states to go. And in the history, think of it, in the history of this great party, we\u2019ve gotten substantially more votes than anybody else by millions \u2013 by many millions more \u2013 than anybody who\u2019s ever run. So that\u2019s a great. You know, when you think Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan and everybody, we have the most votes by far. So that\u2019s something to me that\u2019s very exciting. And overall, it\u2019s just been a very exciting process. I think we\u2019re going to do very well. We have no idea what\u2019s going to happen on the Democrat\u2019s side but they\u2019re certainly having difficulty. I don\u2019t like to see people having difficulty. But if anybody has to have it, let it be them. And I think it\u2019s going to be very interesting. I\u2019m very proud to say that we\u2019ve gotten the most votes and also if you look at the overall primary the amount of votes cast, that\u2019s also a record. So we\u2019ve broken a lot of records in terms of the voters. Our polling has come out and the polls are doing very well as you know. We\u2019re pretty much even and in some cases ahead of Hillary. And I think we\u2019re going to have a very, very successful number of months. And I think it will all culminate in November and we\u2019re going to make America great. Okay? So that\u2019s the way it is\u2026 Question:\n[Inaudible]\n But I\u2019ve raised almost $6 million. All of the money has been paid out and I\u2019m going to give it to you in just a second. In fact, I brought a list just in case that question was asked. But the money has been paid out. I have been thanked by so many veterans\u2019 groups throughout the United States. One gentleman called me up recently crying that out of a blue he got a check for $100,000. I have been thanked by so many groups \u2013 great veterans\u2019 groups. And by the way, outside you have a few people picketing. They\u2019re sent there by Hillary Clinton and they\u2019re picketing that the money wasn\u2019t sent. The money has all been sent. I wanted to keep it private. If we could, I wanted to keep it private because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anybody\u2019s business if I want to send money to the vets. But I have to say this. I raised close to $6 million. It\u2019ll probably be over that amount when it\u2019s all said and done. But as of this moment, it\u2019s $5.6 million. When this started, it started with a speech in Iowa when I said let\u2019s raise some money for the vets and it went up from $1 million to $2 million to $3 million. And it now ends up to be almost $6 million and again I think we can even do better than that.

I mean, why should the networks have a debate like this, make a fortune, sell it to sponsors, and put the money in their coffers. I would much rather give and probably in this case to various groups involved with women\u2019s health issues. I think it\u2019s appropriate. Okay? Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n We\u2019ll have a lot of things to do. We\u2019re going to start rebuilding our military. We have no choice. We have no choice. It\u2019s not like \u201cOh gee, do you want to do it?\u201d We\u2019re going to make our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before. I saw the other day actually on CNN but where the jet fighters we\u2019re using parts from museums and graveyards \u2013 plane graveyards \u2013 where they\u2019re taking old parts for our fighters for F-16s. And they were interviewing some of the pilots. These were great people, and they were saying they were so embarrassed and so ashamed of what\u2019s going on. This shouldn\u2019t be the United States. So we\u2019re going to rebuild our military. We\u2019re going to have the finest equipment in the world again. And nobody\u2019s going to mess with us. Very simple. And by the way, I\u2019m the last person in terms of the draw \u2013 I don\u2019t have to worry about the draw. I\u2019m the last person. I didn\u2019t want to go into Iraq, unlike Hillary and other people, and we shouldn\u2019t have gone into Iraq. Iraq was a mistake. And then the way Obama got us out was a tremendous mistake. So we\u2019re going to have a lot of fun that first 100 days. We\u2019re going to start the process of making America great again. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And again, this was something that was going to happen according to some people in August and some people were saying because of the second convention, which would have been ridiculous. And many people said it was going to go into the July and we had that massive victory in Indiana. I won\u2019t forget the people of Indiana. Believe me, that was a massive, massive victory. And you know, here I am sitting. And I\u2019m watching \u2013 I love watching Hillary and Bernie go at it. In fact, Bernie\u2019s given me some great lines, which I\u2019m using, believe me. But I will say that as far as building the infrastructure of a campaign, the RNC has been doing it for many years. Reince has really upped it and all over the country they have very good people. And part of the benefit is we get to use those people. And while I\u2019m raising a lot of money for them and they\u2019re going to use that not only for me, they\u2019re going to use that also for other people running for office, it\u2019s really been an honor because I\u2019ve met some of the people in different states. I met a big group of people last night from different states that work essentially for the RNC. And you can\u2019t do that over a period of, you know, just a short while because you know, we have \u2013 November\u2019s coming up very rapidly. It\u2019s going to be really soon. And they are set up with some really great infrastructure. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n But again, if you people reveal something to me, I\u2019ll answer the appropriate way. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Hillary is going to abolish the Second Amendment. Okay? Just in case you have any questions. She\u2019s going to abolish your right to own guns. She\u2019s going to abolish the Second Amendment. And I\u2019m exactly the opposite. And I got the endorsement the other day from the NRA, which was a great endorsement and a great honor for me because they are great, amazing people. I\u2019m a member of the NRA. My sons are members of the NRA. But they want to absolutely knock out fracking. And you do that and you\u2019re going to be back in the Middle East and we\u2019re going to be begging for oil again. It\u2019s not going to happen, not with me. We\u2019re going to open it up. We\u2019re going to be energy independent. We\u2019re going to have all sorts of energy. We\u2019re going to have everything you can think of, including solar. And I know a lot about solar. The problem with solar is it\u2019s very expensive. It doesn\u2019t really \u2013 you know, when you have a 30 year payback that\u2019s not exactly the greatest thing in the world. But I know a lot about solar and I\u2019ve gone solar on occasion. But it\u2019s a very, very expensive thing. Wind is very expensive. I mean, wind is without subsidy, wind doesn\u2019t work. You need massive subsidies for wind. And there are places maybe for wind. But if you go to various places in California, wind is killing all of the eagles. You know, if you shoot an eagle or you kill an eagle, they want to put you in jail for five years. And yet, the wind mills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles \u2013 one of the most beautiful, one of the most treasured birds and they\u2019re killing them by the hundreds. And nothing happens. So wind is \u2013 it\u2019s a problem. Plus, it\u2019s very, very expensive and it doesn\u2019t work without subsidy. Despite that, I am into all types of energy. And by the way, while we\u2019re in North Dakota, I have to say this, I love the farmers and the farmers are incredible. We have to remember this was largely a farm state, and they produced tremendous crops of tremendous different goods of which I eat a lot of them. And I just want to pay my respects to the farmers of North Dakota because they have done a great job. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And people like Harold Hamm and people that I know that are really competent, super competent \u2013 believe me \u2013 we will make so much money from that, from energy because we\u2019re blessed with something and you\u2019ll hear some numbers in a little while. We\u2019ll make so much money that we will start to pay down our $19 trillion in debt and we\u2019ll start to lower taxes and we\u2019ll start to take care of our Social Security and our Medicare but we\u2019re going to open it up\u2026 ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s press conference remarks \u2013 Part 6"}, {"text": "Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And I will tell you, I made a speech last night in front of a group and I said regulation \u2013 and this surprised me, really surprised me \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it ever since I\u2019ve been doing this for like 10 months or so. Regulation is even more of a problem for people than the taxes, which surprised me. But they\u2019re both problems. So we\u2019re going to lower \u2013 under my plan \u2013 we\u2019re lowering taxes very substantially as you know for businesses, for middle income, for everybody. So taxes are going way down. We\u2019re going to allow trillions of dollars to pour into the country that are right now outside of this country where people and companies want to bring it in they can. And we\u2019re going to get rid of the tremendous numbers of rules, regulations, probably 75% of which are absolutely terrible for our country. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n She tweets a lot about me. Every once in a while I\u2019ll tweet and when I tweet, not that many people are watching her tweets. When I tweet, they watch. I will say this. Look, she is a senator that\u2019s highly overrated. She\u2019s passed very little legislation. She has been a real disaster for a lot of people, including the Democrats who frankly can\u2019t stand her \u2013 many of the Democrats. Just ask Hillary Clinton how she likes her. And I would say this. I\u2019ll debate anybody. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d debate her. But she\u2019s done very little for Massachusetts, and the beautiful thing is when I won Massachusetts with many people running against, I got up to almost 50% and she was fighting me. So I really think if her record was exposed and the fact that she was a Native American \u2013 she said she was a Native American but she wasn\u2019t able to document it. She said, \u201cWell, I have high cheekbones. You see? I have high cheekbones so I\u2019m a Native American.\u201d And she then I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d call it a fraud or not. But she was able to get into various schools because of the fact she applied as a Native American and probably able to get other things. I think she\u2019s as Native American as I am. Okay? That I will tell you. But she\u2019s a woman that\u2019s been very ineffective other than she\u2019s got a big mouth. Okay? Question:\n[Inaudible]\n But I felt I wasn\u2019t treated right. I did a speech and during the speech, I said let\u2019s see if we can raise some money for the vets and we raised a lot of money. On Tuesday, I think we\u2019re going to have a press conference in Trump Tower \u2013 Tuesday at probably 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. and we\u2019re going to release a full list of all of the people \u2013 almost $6 million of money was raised. Now, when I started \u2013 well, when I started, we weren\u2019t going to raise anything. It was just an idea that came to me. And I said, \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s raise some money for the vets.\u201d And one of my friends who was there \u2013 a very substantial person \u2013 Phil Ruffin offered $1 million. Carl Icahn gave $500,000. Somebody else \u2013 another good friend of mine \u2013 [incomprehensible audio] \u2013 I believe he gave $1 million. And all of a sudden, we started getting a lot of money and I loved seeing it. And on Tuesday, we\u2019re going to release a list of all of the different veterans\u2019 groups that got the money \u2013 pretty close to $6 million worth of money. And that was great.

Through modern day technology, we found out that we\u2019re sitting on energy I\u2019m going to be talking about it in a minute. But that we\u2019re sitting on energy like nobody would believe. I want to be energy independent, and the answer is yes to your question. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Obama could never come up with a solution.

Nobody reported them. People have to report what they see.

Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Now, I\u2019m not saying there shouldn\u2019t be a better deal. Obama would approve it or not approve it. Hillary is probably not going to approve it from what I understand. But I look at it differently. I will absolutely approve it 100%. But I want a better deal because listen here\u2019s the difference between Harold Hamm and myself and you or let\u2019s say Obama, who doesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s doing. Here\u2019s the difference. I\u2019m going to say, \u201cFolks, we\u2019re going to let you build a pipeline. But give us a piece.\u201d We\u2019re going to have to use eminent domain. You know, remember when all the conservatives were \u201cEminent domain. Eminent domain.\u201d Well, their favorite project is the Keystone Pipeline, and if you read the documents on the Keystone Pipeline, a big section is devoted to eminent domain because without eminent domain, that pipeline wouldn\u2019t go 10 feet. You understand that. I want the Keystone Pipeline. But the people of the United States should be given a piece \u2013 a significant piece \u2013 of the profits. Right now, Obama would have said yes or no. And most politicians would say, \u201cYes, we\u2019ll approve it\u201d or \u201cNo, we won\u2019t.\u201d I\u2019m saying \u201cYes, we will absolutely approve it. I want it built. But I want a piece of the profits because we\u2019re making it possible for it to happen through eminent domain and other things, I want a piece of the profits for the United States.\u201d That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to make our country rich again. Just one way out of thousands. But that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to make our country rich again and it\u2019s how we\u2019re going to make America great again.

I\u2019d like to debate\u2026I said to myself I wonder how well I\u2019ll debate. You know because guys like this great gentleman right over here is one of the great oilmen of the world, we\u2019re not debaters. We\u2019re people that put people to work and do things and a lot of good things. How many people do you have working for you? Tens of thousands. That\u2019s what he does. Now, I\u2019d rather debate Harold but I will tell you, he may surprise you. He may do very well. But we don\u2019t do that but somehow it worked out well for me. It worked out well for me. So I actually love the debating process. A lot of fun. I was on center stage for every single debate. And the only time I was upset with some of the networks was when we had even numbers like eight. That means you had two in the middle. So I always insisted on having odd numbers. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n In fact, my speech today is on energy. It\u2019s exactly what it was and is. The federal government, the regulations that they have, they put the coal miners out of business. The coal mines are shut. What they\u2019ve done to the coal \u2013 What Hillary Clinton \u2013 she\u2019s worse than Obama. I mean, she actually openly said \u201cI want to put the coal miners out of business. I want to put the coal mines out of business.\u201d Essentially, she\u2019s saying \u201cI want to put the steel mills out of business.\u201d We\u2019re not going to have any businesses left. So Hillary is I think \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine how she can possibly do well in a place like Pennsylvania. She certainly didn\u2019t do very well in West Virginia. And you know, I think she made a big mistake. She\u2019s catering to certain people but I think ultimately jobs and these incredible people \u2013 the miners, they\u2019re incredible people. I asked a couple of them \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go into some different profession?\u201d They said, \u201cBecause we love going after coal.\u201d I\u2019ll never forget the answer. You know, you think it\u2019s dangerous and you\u2019re going deep down into these incredible crevices. I say \u201cWow.\u201d But they love doing what they do. That\u2019s what they do.

I\u2019m audited all the time so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s that all about. But the IRS has been very professional.

And vast majorities \u2013 I think the approval now is up to over 90%. That\u2019s tremendous from where I started. You know, a little while ago it was like 62%. But I won the elections in landslides. You know, very important to say when you look at these elections. We go to New York, we win almost 62% of the vote with three people running. We then go to Pennsylvania, which is I think a state we\u2019re going to do amazingly well. You know, Hillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of business. They want to put the steel mills out of business. I think I\u2019m going to win Pennsylvania easily. We have tremendous support there. Maryland, Connecticut, we win Delaware, Rhode Island. And then we win as you know I mean we had a tremendous, a tremendous success when we went to Indiana. That was incredible. Bobby Knight helped in all fairness. But Indiana, we\u2019re going win Indiana I think very big. We\u2019re going to have tremendous successes. You know, the thing I think I\u2019m most proud of not the fact that I\u2019m watching Hillary instead of Hillary watching me. You know, we were supposed to be going into July and a lot of people said it wouldn\u2019t even self doing that convention. There\u2019s going to be a new convention in August.

You\u2019ve been amazing right from the beginning. My friend for a long time. And I have been on the cover of every magazine. I think he\u2019s been had as many covers as I have. Maybe more, Harold? So congratulations and thank you very much for your support. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n When you rattle someone, that\u2019s good. Because many of the world \u2013 as you know, many of the countries in our world \u2013 our beautiful world \u2013 have been absolutely abusing us and taking advantage of us. So if they\u2019re rattled in a friendly way \u2013 we\u2019re going to have great relationships with these countries \u2013 but if they\u2019re rattled in a friendly way that\u2019s a good thing\u2026not a bad thing. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And it\u2019s unusual that every time he has a press conference he\u2019s talking about me. So it\u2019s just one of those things. But I will say this: He is a man who shouldn\u2019t be really airing his difficulties and he shouldn\u2019t be airing what he\u2019s airing where he is right now, and I think that you\u2019re going to see it stop pretty soon. He has not done a good job. Today, we\u2019re giving a big speech on energy. We\u2019re going to see some amazing things happen with our country on energy, and I look forward to doing it. But President Obama, you know, you see what\u2019s happened. You see where we\u2019re going. We\u2019re a divided country. We have tremendous difficulties, tremendous problems. And we\u2019re going to solve those problems and we\u2019re going to solve them fast. Okay? Question:\n[Inaudible]\n So I look forward to it and I know he was misquoted a couple of times. He\u2019s been misquoted actually a lot. But we\u2019re going to have women involved at the absolute highest levels.

Only 168 have been revoked. That\u2019s 0.006%. So very, very few and just no difficulty. Hillary wants to go into the opposite direction. She said that President Obama didn\u2019t go far enough when he executed this order when he signed this order. He\u2019s not going far enough. He\u2019s gone so far. He\u2019s gone too far. We\u2019re going to stop it. And we will un-sign lots of different things, including some of those terrible executive orders. Believe me, they\u2019re going to be un-signed so fast they\u2019ll be un-signed the first hour that I\u2019m in office, in the first hour that I\u2019m in office.

This is the behavior of somebody frankly I think that doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s not equipped to be president in so many different ways. But this is the thinking of a person that is not equipped to be the president of the United States. Believe me. She doesn\u2019t understand it. Bad judgment. We talk about it. She\u2019s got bad judgment. You know where it came from. Came from me. It also came from her current opponent, who\u2019s doing pretty well. I\u2019ll tell you, you talk about a rigged system. He wins every week and he keeps losing. I think Bernie should run as an independent, okay? Let him run. I do. I would love him to run as an independent. Then it would be the three of us on stage. I love that. The Second Amendment is on the ballot in November. The only way to save our Second Amendment is to vote for a person that you all know named Donald Trump. Okay? I will tell you. I will never let you down. I will protect our Second Amendment. I will protect our country. Our military will be strong. Our border will be enforced. We\u2019ll get rid of Common Core, which is a disaster. We\u2019ll bring education local. So important. Our education is a mess. We\u2019re going to get rid of Obamacare. We\u2019re going to have a great, great plan as a substitute. Obamacare is out of control. The new cost, as you know, they\u2019re going to be revealed on Nov. 1st. They\u2019re going to be through the roof. And by the way, don\u2019t let this happen. We\u2019ll have to speak to Mitch. Obama is trying to get it delayed until after the election. The new costs will be revealed on Nov. 1st unless he gets it changed and we don\u2019t want that to happen. There will be so astronomical and it will show what a total failure and disaster Obamacare is. We will repeal it and we will replace it with something great. Okay? Believe me. We\u2019re going to have strong borders and we\u2019re going to make the greatest trade deals every country worldwide, every country in the world is ripping off our great country like we\u2019re children. Like taking candy from a baby. Our trade deals will be renegotiated. We won\u2019t be having trade deficits of $500 billion a year with China anymore folks. They won\u2019t be taking our jobs out of here and Kentucky and lots of other places, every place. They won\u2019t be taking our jobs and bringing them into Mexico like with Nabisco where they leave Chicago, moving to Mexico and so many other countries. Companies \u2013 Carrier. You take a look at Carrier Air Conditioning. Just left Indiana. They\u2019re leaving Indiana. They\u2019re moving to Mexico. That\u2019s not happening with me. Because when they make their air conditioners and they sell them across our now very strong border, believe me, they\u2019re going to pay a tax and they\u2019re going to say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to move to Mexico anymore.\u201d It\u2019s so simple. It\u2019s so simple. So we\u2019re going to have great trade agreements. We\u2019re going to become a strong nation again. We\u2019re going to save our Social Security. We\u2019re going to save our Medicare. We\u2019re going to be so proud of this country. You\u2019re going to be proud of your president. But I don\u2019t care about that.

We can\u2019t beat ISIS. Believe me, we\u2019re going to knock the hell out of ISIS. We have no choice. We\u2019re going to knock the hell out of ISIS.

President Obama is even releasing violent criminals from the jails, including drug dealers and those with gun crimes, and they\u2019re being let go by the thousands \u2013 by the thousands. Many of these are also I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not going to be surprised to hear this illegal immigrants. President Obama pushed for changes to sentencing laws that released thousands of dangerous drug trafficking felons and gang members who prey on civilians. Now, I want to tell you, I\u2019ve really learned a lot about the border. In fact, two weeks ago, you probably saw 16,500 border patrol agents endorsed Donald Trump. And we\u2019ve gotten great endorsements. To have the endorsement from NRA today and to have the endorsement from the border patrol agents. And I was talking to them \u2013 these are wonderful people that want to do their job. That\u2019s why they\u2019re endorsing me. They could just sort of \u2013 you know, they\u2019re told to stand back, don\u2019t do it. They want to do their job. These are incredible people. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate and 16,500 so I\u2019m really honored by that. This is Hillary Clinton\u2019s agenda too \u2013 to release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released. She wants people released that you wouldn\u2019t want to walk on the street with, you wouldn\u2019t want to look at. And you know, whether it\u2019s Kate from San Francisco, you see what happened there or Jamiel \u2013 I\u2019ve become great friends with his father. Jamiel was shot in the face three times by somebody that wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. Or and I always say this because this was tragic \u2013 a 65 year old veteran, a woman who was a great woman, raped, sodomized, and killed by an illegal immigrant who wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. We\u2019re going to straighten it out. And by the way, this doesn\u2019t have to do with guns per se but may it has to do with a lot of other things. We\u2019re going to build a wall. It\u2019s going to be a great wall. We\u2019re going to have borders again. People are going to come into the country but they\u2019re coming into the country legally, folks. They\u2019re coming in legally. We\u2019re going to keep our borders open. And I\u2019ll tell you, but they\u2019re going to be open when people come in legally. Now, Hillary wants to just keep them open \u2013 anybody can come across and that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening and the crime is violent and a lot. And lots of other things are happening with the drugs pouring across. So she\u2019s putting the most vulnerable Americans in jeopardy. And this is a risk we can no longer afford. We\u2019ve had enough. I think we\u2019ve had enough. Wouldn\u2019t you say we\u2019ve had like \u2013 In trying to overturn the Second Amendment, Hillary Clinton is telling everyone and every women living in a dangerous community that she doesn\u2019t have the right to defend herself. So you have a woman living in a community \u2013 a rough community, a bad community \u2013 \u201cSorry, you can\u2019t defend yourself.\u201d That is so unfair and that is so egregious. And I\u2019ll tell what, my poll numbers with women are starting to go up. I never thought of it. This should really lift them up, right? Starting to go up. I will say my poll numbers with the men are through the roof. But I like women more than men. Come on, women. Let\u2019s go. Come on. And those people know that about me. Most people know. This is the most basic human right of all but Hillary wants to strip it away and strip it away from women and all others. Hillary Clinton will release violent criminals from jail more so than even Obama. She has a more open policy than Obama if that\u2019s possible and put innocent Americans at risk. I\u2019m going to put criminal behind bars and guarantee that law-abiding Americans have the right to self defense 100%. There are 13 million right to carry permit holders in the United States. I happen to be one of them. In the past \u2013 nobody knows that. Boy, would I surprise somebody if they hit Trump. If I wasn\u2019t surrounded by like the largest group of Secret Service people, who by the way are fantastic people and our police are fantastic, fantastic people, we have to give a standing ovation to our police. We have to. They are fantastic people. Amazing. They do such a great job. They are so unfairly treated. But they know and they know how the people feel about them. Thank you. That\u2019s great. In the past 30 years, the number of right to carry states has gone up seven fold. These are among the most law-abiding folks statistically in the entire country. So they have the right to carry. They\u2019re among the most \u2013 you know, they do statistics on everything. Right? Everything. And these are among the most \u2013 and in fact, they\u2019re like at the top of the list.

Sometimes you get no judges to appoint. Sometimes you go for years and there\u2019s no judges. Probably there\u2019ll be a minimum \u2013 you have Scalia who was one of the greats. Well, his position\u2019s up. Great. He was great. But you have Scalia so you have one before you even start. Assuming and I\u2019m sure that Mitch [McConnell] and the guys are going to be able to hold out. I have no doubt about it because we don\u2019t want anybody taking that slot. But you have Scalia and you\u2019ll probably have three \u2013 it could be four and it could even be five judges. So I think in terms of presidential \u2013 and we\u2019re talking about a four-year period. And of course, we tend to be there for eight years. But we\u2019ll make it so good in four that you\u2019ll probably say, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do it any longer, Mr. President.\u201d But I can\u2019t stress in any stronger fashion whoever the next president is going to appoint from three to five judges. And if it\u2019s Hillary or whoever, assuming she\u2019s allowed to run because you know what? What she did with her emails is so criminal and so dishonest, is so shocking that she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run but it looks like they\u2019re going to let her run. And that\u2019s okay with me because really I do want to run against her. I have to be honest with you. So if she gets to appoint her judges, she will as part of it abolish the Second Amendment and I have to say that would be in my opinion that\u2019s what she\u2019s going to go for and it\u2019s a little like what she did with the coal miners. She said about, you know, she\u2019s going to put the coal miners, she\u2019s going to put the mines out of business. Then she went to West Virginia and she said, \u201cWell, I\u2019d try to retract.\u201d You know, she tried to retract it. It didn\u2019t work out too well for her. She got really beaten badly. Hillary wants to disarm vulnerable Americans in high crime neighborhoods. Whether it\u2019s a young single mom in Florida or a grandmother in Ohio, Hillary wants them to be defenseless, wants to take away any chance they have of survival. And by the way, you have men and you have women sitting in an apartment and outside is tremendous crime \u2013 tremendous crime of all kinds \u2013 and they need to be protected and you know the only way they\u2019re going to be able to protect themselves. And if you take away that gun from them, it\u2019s going to be very unfair situation. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to call her Heartless Hillary. We can do without that. Somehow I like crooked Hillary better. I put forth and you probably saw it a few days ago, I put forth a list of judges who will protect and defend all of our freedoms, including the Second Amendment. The judges will follow the Constitution and these were all highly vetted \u2013 the Federalist Society, Heritage, some great references from Jeff Sessions \u2013 a fantastic man, from Mitch and from a whole group of people. And we put down 11. I\u2019ll be adding some additional names over a period of the next month or so sometime prior to the convention. I hope you can all go to the convention. I hope you can come. And we\u2019re going to be putting some additional names and I think you\u2019re going to be very happy with them. But it\u2019s been reviewed incredibly well. People love these people. And I\u2019d though I do that because I really think it brings the party together. It really is going \u2013 I mean the effect it\u2019s had is incredible because they weren\u2019t sure. Will Trump appoint this one or that one? Who will the judges be? Such an important thing. So I put together the list with some incredibly important organizations that are highly respected and everybody\u2019s really happy. You\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve got A-plus reviews on that. Now, I\u2019d like to call for Hillary Clinton to put together a list also. Okay? Let her put together a list because I\u2019d like to see what that list consists of. And you will see it\u2019s day and night and it will not be good for the people in this room. And it won\u2019t be good by the way for the people of our country, most importantly. So, Americans use guns to defend themselves against violent crime more than a million times a year. More than a million times a year. And they want to take them away. Heartless hypocrites like the Clintons want to take this and they want to get rid of guns. And yet, they have body guards that have guns. So I think that in addition to calling for them to name judges, we\u2019ll also call them and let their body guards immediately disarm. Okay? Now, they should immediately disarm and let\u2019s see how good they do. Let\u2019s see how they feel walking around without their guns on their body guards. In the meantime, nobody else can have the guns. Right? ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech at the NRA Leadership Forum \u2013 Part 4"}, {"text": "\u201cPut your guns away\u201d.

Maybe I shouldn\u2019t read you what I have here but \u2013 In fact, if I would have known teleprompters I would have used them. I started to use them a little bit. They\u2019re not bad. You never get yourself in trouble when you use a teleprompter. You know, the problem is it\u2019s too easy. We have a president who uses teleprompters. It\u2019s too easy. We should have non-teleprompter speeches only when you\u2019re running for president. You find out about people\u2026 So, the Second Amendment is under a threat like never before. Crooked Hillary Clinton is the most anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment candidate ever to run for office and as I said before she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to take your guns away. She wants to abolish it. Just remember that. The NRA and the late hero \u2013 he was a great guy \u2013 Charlton Heston, who many of you knew. I met him a few times. He was an incredible guy. Did battle with the Clintons to protect our Second Amendment. The NRA has led the fight time and time again to protect our fundamental freedom. This is an amazing group\u2026These are incredible people and they really \u2013 this isn\u2019t like a job. They really, really believe. And we\u2019re all lucky to have people like that. I will tell you. Really lucky. Of course, if they didn\u2019t endorse me, maybe I wouldn\u2019t say that. I would. Hillary Clinton wants to reverse the Supreme Court decision D.C. v. Heller upholding the right to keep and bear arms. Hillary said the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. That\u2019s bad. That\u2019s like what she said about the miners \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re going to put the miners and the mines out of business.\u201d Then she goes \u2013 right? Then she goes to \u2013 oh, I\u2019ll tell you, West Virginia. How were they? I\u2019d hate to say I won Kentucky but I won West Virginia by even more. I really \u2013 but of course she made that statement after I had already won Kentucky. We\u2019re going to win them all. We\u2019re going to win them all. We\u2019re going to win them all. If Hillary gets to appoint her judges, this is really important. Look, defense is number one. We have to protect our country. Defense. Economy is all important. Everything is important. But without defense, we don\u2019t have a country. And our military, as you know, is being decapitated. What they are doing to our military is incredible. I saw over the weekend a documentary on our great airmen. And these are people that are flying our jets and they\u2019re running out of parts for our fighter jets. And these are fighter pilots. These are incredible men. And they\u2019re going to junk yards \u2013 plane grave yards they call them where the planes are. They\u2019re grave yards where the old planes \u2013 and they\u2019re taking parts off. They\u2019re cannibalizing the planes. They\u2019re taking parts off the planes and they\u2019re putting them onto the jets. And I\u2019m saying, \u201cIs this the United States? Why don\u2019t we have new equipment?\u201d And a man got up \u2013 a great guy \u2013 looks as good or better than Tom Cruise, and you know what I\u2019m talking about because that was a great movie. And he said, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019ve been in this for 20 years and it used to be so incredible. And now it\u2019s like a different world. The equipment, the way it\u2019s being maintained, everything. It\u2019s like a different world.\u201d And I just have to say, just to interrupt what I\u2019m going to be talking about, I have to say we\u2019re going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody \u2013 nobody \u2013 is going to push us around.

I\u2019m debating people that were on their national debating teams and all of these top debaters. But they\u2019ve never had people interrupting them every other word they\u2019re saying \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re a liar\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re a liar\u201d \u2013 they\u2019re trying to speak and they can\u2019t speak.

And again, my sons have been members of the NRA for many, many years, and they\u2019re incredible. They have so many rifles and so many guns sometimes even I get a little bit concerned. I say that\u2019s a lot. Okay? But I will tell you they are \u2013 they know so much about it. Really, they\u2019re surrogates. They go around and speak. And every time they speak to a gun organization or a club, people call me and they say \u201cYour boys are great boys and boy do they know their business.\u201d So, it\u2019s one of those things and it\u2019s the way we want it. And you know, I\u2019ve mentioned so often we talk about Paris or we talk about San Bernardino and nobody had guns. You know, Paris is probably in the world the toughest place to have a gun. The toughest. France, generally, but Paris in particular. And when these thugs walked in \u2013 thugs. You know, the press used to call them \u201cmasterminds\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re masterminds we\u2019re looking\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s why people are joining. That\u2019s why people are coming in because you\u2019re using the word \u201cmastermind\u201d. Not mastermind \u2013 thugs. In fact, I call them the guy with the dirty cap. Remember the white cap? And it was filthy dirty. This was the \u201cmastermind\u201d. And actually, the press has stopped using the term. They\u2019re very dishonest people. Among the most dishonest I\u2019ve ever met but they actually stopped using the term \u201cmastermind\u201d because they use that term and then they wonder why our youth is going and fighting for ISIS. They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re fighting for. But I think it\u2019s gotten a lot better from that standpoint. But if you look at Paris, 130 people killed, hundreds of people still in the hospital. Just horribly wounded. Can never be the same. Horribly wounded. And these guys came in \u2013 boom! Boom! Boom! You over here \u2013 boom! And they just stood there and just shot everybody. No guns in the other side, folks. If you would have had guns on the other side, if I took a couple of these folks in here \u2013 some especially wearing the red caps \u2013 Make America Great Again \u2013 I promise there wouldn\u2019t have been 130 people killed and hundreds of people lying in the hospital to this day. It might not have happened because if they knew there were guns in the room, it might have happened. But if it did, you would have had bullets going in the opposite direction and believe me, the carnage would not have been the same by any stretch of the imagination. And I tell the same story on San Bernardino. Here is two people. I guess she radicalized him. Who knows? Who knows? It\u2019s a mess. We\u2019re in a mess folks. A mess. Radical Islamic terrorism. We have a president doesn\u2019t mention the words, doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, and if you don\u2019t want to talk about it, you\u2019re never going to solve a very big problem and we\u2019re talking a worldwide problem. We\u2019re not talking here. We\u2019re not talking Kentucky. We\u2019re talking all over the world this is a problem, and we have a president doesn\u2019t want to mention the name. You have San Bernardino \u2013 14 people. They worked with these two. They worked with them. They gave them a baby shower. They had a baby. The people they worked with gave them a baby shower. They walked in. No guns on the other side. They had the guns and they killed 14 people. Many wounded. Many in the hospital to this day. But they wounded many. But they killed 14 of their co-workers, and the co-workers thought they were friends. So there\u2019s something going on. Now, I\u2019ll tell you again, same story. If we had guns in the other side, it wouldn\u2019t have been that way. I would have boom! If we had guns on the other side, it wouldn\u2019t have been that way. And then you have gun-free zones. The gun-free zones. That\u2019s real. We had a case, you know, about a year and a half ago. It was the first I really heard of this where you had the five military people \u2013 great people \u2013 one was a master marksman \u2013 a master with anything he touched having to do with guns, weapons, anything he touched. And they were told \u2013 this was on a military base, folks, on a military base. They were told put your guns away. These are soldiers. These are people that are representing us. These were the top of the line. These were five great brave incredible soldiers.

I knew I was doing well but I did not know that. And I\u2019ve been a member for a long time and my boys are members and they\u2019re much better shooters than I am. They know more about guns than any \u2013 I don\u2019t know there might be two or three people in this room but believe it or not, not many. So to get the endorsement, believe me, is a fantastic honor. And I just said to Wayne and I just said to Chris I will not let you down. Remember that, I will not let you down. And you know, I wrote a few remarks and I\u2019m actually going to read them because we\u2019re going into a little detail but I will tell you that Hillary Clinton \u2013 and you know, I call her Crooked Hillary because all you have to do is read any newspaper you want. But Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment. Just remember that. We\u2019re not talking about changing. She wants to abolish the Second Amendment. So we\u2019re not going to let that happen, I can tell you that right now. We\u2019re going to preserve it. We\u2019re going to cherish it. We\u2019re going to take care of it. Okay? You know, they keep chipping away. They talk about the magazines. They talk about the bullets. We\u2019re going to take care of it. You know, a couple of things before I give you some more detailed remarks. I feel really happy with what\u2019s going on. You know, the Fox poll came out three days ago and in the Fox poll I\u2019m leading Hillary 41 to 44. 44. And last night, Rasmussen, which is a highly respected poll, came out \u2013 Trump 42, Crooked Hillary Clinton 37. So we\u2019re doing well. Now, with all that, we have a long way to go. But if you get every one of your friends to go vote because there\u2019s a big difference \u2013 you know, on a lot of things there\u2019s a difference and some are subtle, some are big. And by the way, we\u2019re in Kentucky. We\u2019re going to put the miners back to work before I forget about that. We\u2019re going to put the miners \u2013 we just left and I also won Kentucky so I love Kentucky. I used to work in Cincinnati. For two summers, I worked in Cincinnati doing a job with my father. And I loved Cincinnati and I\u2019d come over the line and I\u2019d be in Kentucky. You\u2019d be surprise how much I know about Kentucky. But it\u2019s an amazing place. But I said when I won New York, because we won New York in a landslide, and then Pennsylvania and Maryland and we won everything. We were winning everything. We won Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island. And then we went to West Virginia and boy did I win. Did we do well in West Virginia? Wow. But all landslides. We won in all of the states I mentioned and more \u2013 every single county in every single state. That\u2019s called a victory. And we won by massive percentages in the 60s and some in the 70s. And then of course we went to Indiana. As you know, that was going to be \u2013 that was going to be the firewall for the other side. And it turned out to be a massive victory for us again. It didn\u2019t hurt that Bobby Knight came out and said \u201cI want Trump to win.\u201d That didn\u2019t hurt. If you\u2019re in Indiana and Bobby Knight endorses you, I guess that\u2019s about as good as it gets. So I just want to say that I\u2019ve been watching what\u2019s going on and I\u2019ve been looking at airplanes getting blown up in the air and lots of bad things happening. It\u2019s just not the same. And we\u2019re going to bring it back and we\u2019re going to bring it back to a real place where we don\u2019t have to be so frightened, where we don\u2019t have to be so afraid. And you know what\u2019s happening in the schools and you know what\u2019s happening everywhere. We\u2019re going to bring it back and you folks are going to be so happy and you\u2019re going to be so proud of your country again. Just remember. Bernie Sanders, who I\u2019m sure you all love, he did say one thing that was very interesting. He said that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be the president of the United States.

Here\u2019s a guy gives me all good marks. He\u2019s late so they\u2019re starting a new lawsuit. Now here\u2019s the thing; this law firm \u2013 because this is like a life study \u2013 this law firm gave a lot of money to the Attorney General of New York, who\u2019s a total lightweight. His name is Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Schneiderman accepts their money, goes to meet with President Obama in Syracuse, when Obama was in Syracuse, and then the next day or two, files a lawsuit against me because they, in my opinion, they gave him a contribution, then goes to see Obama. Just wanting to see how the system works folk. It\u2019s a bad system. Let me tell you. So Obama meets with this dopey Eric Schniederman, who hates our governor. And he wants to run for governor but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen. They go up to Syracuse, meets with Obama and he files a lawsuit. So, bottom line is this. People said you can settle. In fact a lot of people said, \u201cOh before you run, you should settle.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care, the people understand it and they use it.\u201d So when I have 10,000 people and when we have mostly unbelievable reviews, how do you settle? And in fact when the case started originally, I said \u201cHow can I settle when I have a review like this. Every review is good!\u201d Now I should\u2019ve settled but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. So I\u2019ll be seeing you in November either as President. And I will say this, I have all these great reviews but I will say this, I think Judge Curiel should be ashamed of himself. I think it\u2019s a disgrace that he\u2019s doing this. And I look forward to going before a jury, not this judge, a jury, and we will win that trial. We will win that trial, check it out. Check it out, folks. You know, I tell this to people, Nov. 28th I think it\u2019s scheduled. It shouldn\u2019t be a trial. It should be a summary judgment dismissal. By the way, friends of mine that are great lawyers, in fact, one of them represents you, said \u201cHow the hell do you get sued under RICO for a guy that took a course, loved the course, said great things about the course, and then you get sued under RICO?\u201d It is a disgrace. Now, I\u2019m talking about Bernie Sanders has a rigged system; it is rigged. I\u2019m talking about I had a rigged system except we won by so much. I will tell you, this court system, the judges in this court system, federal court, they ought to look into Judge Curiel, because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace. Okay?

I think they\u2019re going to love me. So here\u2019s what happens. We get sued by a woman and she turns out to be a disaster for them. Her name is Tarla Makaeff. She rated on the report card it\u2019s one to five, five being excellent, the highest mark. She gave me a five across the board. All fives. She then did a video saying it was fantastic \u2013 the most glowing video you\u2019ve ever seen. She then sued me because she wanted her money back. She was such a disaster that this judge, it was her against us. She was such a disaster that this judge allowed her to get out of the case. But we want her to be in the case. And the lawyer said, \u201cYour Honor! We want her to be in the case.\u201d He said \u201cShe\u2019s out of the case.\u201d So now we have others. So we said, \u201cDismiss the case! She\u2019s out of the case.\u201d \u201cNo, we won\u2019t dismiss the case.\u201d So we have 10,000 surveys from former students giving Trump University rave reviews. It\u2019s called and it\u2019s on the website, www.98percentapproval.com. Okay? So we have Marla, so we have Makaeff giving us these great numbers. Then we have another one. Bob Guillo. They used him, I think it was Bush \u2013 Jeb Bush, low energy. We have these guys making commercials. Now look, in all fairness, it hasn\u2019t hurt me much because, you know, they use this thing, every once in a while you have one. And we\u2019re going to win. But if I don\u2019t win, and even if I do win, we want to, my kids will open it up again, because it was a terrific school. It was great. It was good. So we have a guy named Bob Guillo, he appeared in a TV attack ad. Can you believe it? They used him on ads against me. I had 66,000 negative ads. Over $100 million in Florida alone during the big primary, which I won in a landslide. We had 15,000 negative ads and I won. I almost wonder what do ads mean if you want to know the truth. So you have this guy, Bob Guillo. He appeared in TV attack ads even though he rated the programs a five, meaning excellent, the top mark, across the board. His primary complaint was he would\u2019ve liked to have more comfortable chairs. Okay? Unbelievable. Then we have a guy named Art Cohen and he was late to file. So he signed a survey in which he rated the program, either a four or a five. I will tell you this, how smart was it to ask everybody that took the course to sign a report, card? Now you know what the lawyers are saying? The lawyers are saying \u201cOh, but they were forced. 10,000 people were forced. They were forced and you have pictures.\u201d We actually have video tapes of people, they weren\u2019t forced. A professor said, \u201cWould you sign how you like it?\u201d So that\u2019s it. So he signed all fives and fours out of a possible, the highest marks, and indicated that his only complaint was a lack of nice lunch sandwiches. Okay? Think of it. So he was late, so they went to the judge, and the judge said \u201cHe was late.\u201d Why don\u2019t you file under RICO? Organized crime?\u201d Now we\u2019ve all been sued in business for RICO.

And it\u2019s a disgrace the way the federal court is acting because it\u2019s a simple lawsuit. Everybody that took the so-called course, it\u2019s Trump University is in San Diego! And the trial, they wanted to start while I\u2019m running for president. The trial is going to take place sometime in November. There should be no trial. This should\u2019ve been dismissed on summary judgment easily. Everybody says it, but I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. He\u2019s a hater. His name is Gonzalo Curiel. And he is not doing the right thing. And I figure, \u2018What the hell. Why not talk about it for two minutes?\u2019 Should I talk about it? Yes? So we should\u2019ve won. I\u2019m being railroaded. So here\u2019s the story. Very simple story. A number of years ago, a long time ago now, I open up a school, a little school, we called it Trump University, changed the name, we had probably I don\u2019t know, a lot of people like 10,000 people. You, did you like it? She said she was there, she liked it. Here\u2019s the story. So we open up and it really was successful from the beginning. Then we get these class action lawyers, they immediately sue. My people did a good job for a couple of reasons. One of the reasons was they had everybody that took the course sign like a report card. So we had, let\u2019s say 10,000 people, almost that many sign the report card. And the report cards are unbelievable. By the way, without that it\u2019s their word versus these people or me. But I\u2019m getting railroaded by a legal system that frankly they should be ashamed. Because this is a case, that I\u2019ll be here in November. Hey! If I win as president, it\u2019s a civil case, I could\u2019ve settled this case numerous times, but I don\u2019t want to settle cases when we\u2019re right. I don\u2019t believe in it. And when you start settling cases, you know what happens? Everybody sues you because you get known as a settler. One thing about me, I am not known as a settler. And people understand that this whole thing, with this whole deal, with the lawyers, class-action lawyers, they\u2019re the worst. It\u2019s a scam. So here\u2019s what happens; we\u2019re in front of a very hostile judge. The judge was appointed by Barack Obama, federal judge. Frankly he should recuse himself. Because he\u2019s given us ruling after ruling after \u2013 negative, negative, negative. I have a top lawyer who said he\u2019s never seen anything like this before. So what happens is, we get sued. We have a magistrate named William Gallo who truly hates us, and this is what. Now, the good news is, it\u2019s a jury trial. But we can\u2019t even get a full jury. We\u2019re entitled to a jury, we want a jury of 12 people, and you\u2019re gonna watch. First of all, it should be dismissed before the trial, but if we have a trial, we\u2019ll go all the way. Watch how we win it because I\u2019ve been treated unfairly. Very much like with the veterans, where I raise all that money but on Tuesday I\u2019m announcing all of the groups that we\u2019ve given almost $6 million to. You know you turn things around. So here\u2019s the story. We have a law-firm named Robbins Geller, where basically, Robbins Geller is a spinoff of two law firms \u2013 [inaudible]\u2026 Two of those partners went to jail for an extended period of time for doing very bad things legally. This same group is the lawyers against. ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s rant on Judge Gonzalo Curiel \u2013 Part 1"}, {"text": "Now, let\u2019s be clear. We don\u2019t know what Donald pays in taxes because he is the first presidential nominee in 40 years to refuse to disclose his tax returns. I mean, look, maybe he is just a lousy businessman and he doesn\u2019t want everyone to know that he\u2019s not as rich as he claims to be. But we do know this: The last time that his taxes were made public, Donald Trump paid nothing. Zero. Zero. Zero taxes before, and for all we know, he\u2019s paying zero taxes today. And he\u2019s proud of it. Two weeks ago, he said he was more than happy to dodge taxes because he doesn\u2019t want to throw his money \u201cdown the drain\u201d. Donald Trump likes being a billionaire but he doesn\u2019t think that the rules that apply to everyone else should apply to him. But let\u2019s be clear. Donald Trump didn\u2019t get rich on his own. His businesses rely on roads and bridges paid for by the rest of us. His businesses rely on workers who are educated by the rest of us. They rely on police and firefighters who protect the rest of us and who are supported by the rest of us. Donald Trump and his businesses are protected by a world class military that defends us abroad and keeps us safe at home and the rest of us pay to support. When anyone builds something terrific, they should get to keep a big hunk of it. But they should also pay a fair share forward so that the next kid and the next kid and the next kid and the next kid will have a chance to build something too. That\u2019s how we build a real future in America. And that goes double for Donald Trump. He inherited a fortune from his father, kept it going by scamming people, declaring bankruptcy and then skipping out on what he owed. Let\u2019s be clear. Nurses and teachers and dockworkers, they paid their fair share to keep Trump\u2019s businesses going. Programmers and engineers and small business owners, they paid their fair share to support our military who showed courage and sacrifice everyday. Donald Trump thinks that supporting them is throwing money down the drain. Then I\u2019d say we throw Donald Trump down the drain. Let\u2019s face it. Donald Trump is about exactly one thing \u2013 Donald Trump. It is time for some accountability because these statements disqualify Donald Trump to ever be president of the United States. The free ride is over. Now, I focused tonight on the urgent threat that is Donald Trump for exactly that reason because the threat is urgent. But we all know that beating Trump is only one step toward rebuilding America\u2019s working families. The central question at this juncture in our history is who this country works for \u2013 whether this country works billionaires like Trump and their big bank friends or whether this country works for everyone else, for the people who get up everyday and work their tails off and who are sick and tired of always getting the short end of the stick. That\u2019s what matters. And each and everyone of you works on different pieces of that fight \u2013 Wall Street accountability and Fed reform, minimum wage and overtime pay, fair scheduling, a livable planet, workers\u2019 rights and racial justice. You know the list. You know the stakes. You know the challenges. But I know one thing: whether we\u2019re talking about Donald Trump or we\u2019re talking about changing this country, you can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t fight. And we\u2019re in this fight and we\u2019re in it to win. Thank you all so much. ", "name": "Transcript: Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s remarks on Donald Trump \u2013 Part 2"}, {"text": "\u2026Unfortunately, if you\u2019ve been watching the presidential race, you know that we need to stand up now more than ever. Just yesterday, it came out that Donald Trump had said back in 2007 that is the year before the Estradas [sp] lost their home that he was \u201cexcited for the real estate market to crash\u201d because \u201cI\u2019ve always made more money in bad markets than good\u201d. That\u2019s right. The rest of us were horrified by what happened during the 2008 financial crisis, by what happened to millions of families like Mr. Estrada\u2019s that were forced out of their homes. But Donald Trump was drooling over the idea of a housing meltdown because it meant he could buy up more property on the cheap. What kind of a man does that? What kind of a man roots for people to get thrown out of their house? What kind of many roots for people to get thrown out of their jobs? To root for people to lose their pensions? To root for two little girls in Clark County, Nevada to end up living out of a van? What kind of a man does that? I\u2019ll tell you exactly what kind of a man does that. It is a man who cares about no one but himself. A small insecure money grubber who doesn\u2019t care who gets hurt so long as he makes a profit off it. What kind of a man does that? A man who will never be president of the United States. Now sometimes, sometimes Trump claims that he is tough on Wall Street, tough on the guys who cheated people like Mr. Estrada. You may have heard him say that. But now, oh, he\u2019s singing a very different song. Last week, he said that the new Dodd-Frank financial regulations have \u2013 and I\u2019m going to quote here \u2013 made it impossible for bankers to function. And he will put a new plan soon that \u201cwill be close to dismantling Dodd-Frank\u201d. Donald Trump is worried about helping poor little Wall Street. Let me find the world\u2019s smallest violin to play a sad, sad song. No, really. Can Donald Trump even name three things about Dodd-Frank? Someone should ask. Right? But this much \u2013 this much \u2013 Donald Trump should know. If he is so tough on Wall Street, then he should be cheering on Dodd-Frank\u2019s capital leverage requirements that have made the big banks less likely to fail. If he is so tough on Wall Street, he should be cheering on Dodd-Frank\u2019s living will process, which has helped push big banks to become safer. If he is so tough on Wall Street, he should be cheering on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has forced those big banks to return $11 billion directly to people they cheated. He should be but he is not. Now that he is sewn up the Republican nomination, Donald Trump is dropping all pretense. He\u2019s kissing the fannies of the poor misunderstood Wall Street bankers. But the American people are a whole lot smarter than Donald Trump thinks they are. The American people are not looking for a bait and switch. They are not looking for a man so desperate for power that he will say or do anything to get elected. You know, take the hint, Donald. The time for letting big banks call all the shots in Washington is over. And I just want to make one more point about Donald Trump \u2013 a point that won\u2019t quite fit into a Twitter war \u2013 but the last point I want to make really sums up Donald Trump and what he\u2019s all about \u2013 his taxes.

McConnell\u2019s leadership Senate Republicans almost came within hours of shutting down the Department of Homeland Security because of President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration. They can talk about their outlook on families. Donald Trump and the Republican leader can mention how little they\u2019ve done for American families. Now they\u2019re going to cut Medicaid and Medicare. I guess that\u2019s because he\u2019s getting wind up from the meeting with Paul Ryan because that\u2019s his number one issue. Since the Republican leader has established himself in Donald Trump\u2019s corner, one can only assume he\u2019s okay with Trump\u2019s shady business practices. He doesn\u2019t mind that Donald Trump rips off hardworking Americans, filed bankruptcy many, many times, has a university that\u2019s corrupt and the trial will go forward during the election. Sadly, disregard for the middle class is all too [familiar] a position for today\u2019s Republicans. The Republican Party refuses to address the minimum wage, college affordability or any other legislation that helps families. Now, here\u2019s a doozy. They can spend a lot of time talking about climate change. Trump and the Republican leader can in his private conversation talk about denial of climate change. 97% of all scientists worldwide believe that it\u2019s here \u2013 it\u2019s upon us. Ask the senior senator from Florida, he\u2019ll tell you that it\u2019s here. Look what\u2019s happening in Miami. You can talk to senators from Virginia, they\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s happening in military bases on the coasts of Virginia. Donald Trump\u2019s highest ranking supporter in Congress, Sen. McConnell, assuringly agrees with Trump that climate change is a hoax. Here\u2019s what Trump said \u2013 \u201c[hoax] perpetrated by Chinese manufacturers\u201d. That position fits with a Republican Party that refuses acknowledge the environmental and national security threats posed by climate change. If elected, Trump and Sen. McConnell would lead the nation backward on a climate change agenda that would put polluters first and make U.S. the laughing stock of the world. More than 170 countries have agreed to address climate change because of the United States\u2019s leadership. But Trump and McConnell have stated publicly they\u2019ll walk away from this. So let\u2019s talk about this Republicans like to talk about \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with the economy \u2013 keeping in mind that Bill Clinton balanced the budget. Keep in mind that when George Bush came into the presidency, there was a $10 trillion\u2026surplus over 10 years. Surplus over 10 years. I misspoke \u2013 it was $7 trillion over 10 years. And with two wars unpaid for costing trillions of dollars, with tax cuts not being paid for, that is long since gone \u2013 that surplus. So they can talk about that. They can talk about how Trump has said he thinks that America should fall on its debt just to get the people we owe money to to take less money. That\u2019s what he said. He doesn\u2019t want to pay our national debt, and it seems on that issue that there\u2019s little distance between him and the Republican leader. Sen. McConnell has presided over a Republican caucus that has taken America to the brink of default on a number of occasions \u2013 not the least of which is shutting the government down \u2013 this great government \u2013 shutting it down for 17 days. Closed, out of business. So, Donald Trump and the Republican leader should have a long, long conversation. They have a lot to talk about. At some point in their conversation, Donald Trump should thank the senior senator from Kentucky. Trump owes his candidacy to the Republican leader and the policies that he\u2019s led. It was an obstructionist, anti-woman, anti-Latino, anti-Muslim, anti-middle class, anti-environment, anti-Obama, and anti-everything.

It\u2019s just the latest signs that Republican leaders in both houses are marching in lock-step with Donald Trump. Sen. McConnell has fully embraced Donald Trump. As he said last week when Trump secured the Republican nomination, \u201cI have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters.\u201d While speaking to reporters earlier this week, the Republican leader sounded enthusiastic about Trump\u2019s chances in the general election. I guess he should be giddy but in a Trump presidency Donald Trump is everything that the Republican leader and his party could ever want in a nomination. Trump\u2019s policy positions are identical to the Republican Party platform and today Sen. McConnell can discuss running mate in an hour or two of that consensus with Trump. Let\u2019s talk about the Supreme Court. Donald Trump and the senator from Kentucky can talk about their obstruction for the first time in the history of the country to a presidential Supreme Court nomination. We\u2019ve had never happened before. We\u2019ve had some stalling, a couple of filibusters but this is one where people didn\u2019t want to meet, people who have broken from that, certainly not want to have a hearing, and they don\u2019t want to vote. Trump said the Republicans should delay, delay, delay filling the Supreme Court vacancy. Following Trump\u2019s lead, the Republican leader has personally overseen the blockade of Judge Garland\u2019s nomination, forcing his Senators to fall in line. Let\u2019s talk about Trump and women. I mean, when they get together, they can talk about their policies, about being anti-woman. Since Sen. McConnell has so enthusiastically praised Trump, we can only assume that he agrees with Trump\u2019s view that women are dogs and pigs and can only assume that the Republican leader is not repulsed by Donald Trump\u2019s vulgar behavior towards women. Look at his New York Times story yesterday cavorting with Howard Stern and how they talk about women. After all, the Republican Party has spent years blocking every substantive bill for American women equal pay for equal work. Republican senators have undermined women\u2019s health at every turn, trying to turn Planned Parenthood into a punching bag even though millions and millions of American women have been helped by Planned Parenthood. They will have an opportunity this morning to talk about the anti-Latino vote. They can discuss their anti-immigrant policies and their agenda. Since the Republican leader\u2019s all in for Donald Trump, we can only assume that he approves Trump\u2019s calling immigrants rapists and murderers, the DREAMers as being mules for drug dealing. I assume they can have a long discussion about the wall, how high it should be, how they\u2019re going to get the Mexicans to pay for the wall even though most people think the idea is insane. Let\u2019s not forget Republicans have demagogued Latinos and immigrants for decades. They\u2019re doing it today. ", "name": "Transcript: Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s floor statement on Donald Trump \u2013 Part 1"}, {"text": "Question:\n[Inaudible]\u2026 House Speaker Paul Ryan:\nWe discussed those issues at great detail. Question:\n[Inaudible]\u2026You have defined modern conservatism along the lines of entitlement reform, pro-trade and immigration, both on the Muslim ban and dealing with the issue comprehensively those who are not Muslims\u2026Aren\u2019t you papering over these rather sizable differences in not only how conservatives is defined broadly but also how you have tried to define it for this House, Congress? House Speaker Paul Ryan:\nRight. So I represent a wing of the conservative party, you could say. He\u2019s bringing in a whole new wing. He\u2019s bringing new voters that we\u2019ve never had for decades. That\u2019s a positive thing. The point though is can we agree on the common core principles that unite all of us. We will have policy disputes. There\u2019s no two ways about that. All Republicans do. Look, Mitt Romney and I didn\u2019t agree on everything in 2012. So we will have policy disputes. I\u2019m not interested in litigating the past. I am interested in going forward and seeing where that common ground exists to make sure that we can have a unified Republican Party that yes, there will be different Republicans that have different views on various policy ideas. The question is can we unify on common core principles that make our party and by the way, the principles that built this country. And I\u2019m very encouraged that the answer to that question is yes. Question:\n[Inaudible]\u2026How do you interpret his success? Is it going to mean a real, fundamental realignment of the party because of these new voters that he\u2019s bringing in? House Speaker Paul Ryan:\nIt\u2019s really kind of unparalleled, I think. He has gotten more votes than any Republican primary nominee in the history of our country, and this isn\u2019t even over yet. He hasn\u2019t even gone to like California yet. So it\u2019s really a remarkable achievement. So the question is and this is what we think we could be a party to helping. How do we unify it all so this is really a big and growing movement? How do we keep adding and adding and adding in voters while not subtracting any voters? And to me that means a positive vision based on core principles, taking those principles, applying them to the problems facing our country today, and offering people positive solutions and speaking to people where they are life, addressing their anxieties and show that we have a better plan. Look, here\u2019s what we agree on. A Hillary Clinton presidency would be a disaster for this country. It\u2019s effectively a third Obama term. And the other thing we all know is most Americans do not like where this country is headed. Seven out of 10 Americans think America is on the wrong track. We agree with that. So the question is can we unify around our common principles to offer the country a compelling and clear choice in an agenda going forward so that the men and women of this nation get a real and honest choice about how to fix this country and get us on a better track. And I\u2019m very encouraged that we can put that together. Question:\n[Inaudible]\u2026On CNN, Donald Trump said he was not ready to support your agenda. Did he change his mind today? House Speaker Paul Ryan:\nWe talked about all of these issues and our policy teams are meeting to just walk through details. So again, this is a process. We just began this process. I\u2019m very encouraged at the first meeting of this process. And going forward, we\u2019re going to go a little deeper into the policy leads to make sure we have a better understanding of one another.

If you\u2019re not, what is holding you back? And do you really have a choice? I mean, you\u2019ve ruled out voting for Hillary Clinton \u2013 House Speaker Paul Ryan:\nLook, the process of unifying the Republican Party which just finished a primary about a week ago \u2013 perhaps one of the most divisive primaries in memory \u2013 takes some time. Look, there are some people who are for Donald Trump, who are for Ted Cruz, who are for John Kasich, who are for Marco Rubio and everybody else. And it\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t fake unifying \u2013 we don\u2019t pretend unification, that we truly and actually unify so that we are full strength in the fall. I don\u2019t want us to have a fake unification process here. I want to make sure that we really truly understand each other and that we are committed to the conservative principles that make the Republican Party, that built this country. And again, I\u2019m very encouraged. I heard a lot of good things from our presumptive nominee and we exchanged differences of opinion on a number of things that, you know, everybody knows we have. There are policies disputes that we will have. There\u2019s no two ways about it. Plenty of Republicans disagree with one another on policy disputes. But on core principles \u2013 those are the kinds of things that we discussed. And again, I\u2019m encouraged. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n House Speaker Paul Ryan:\nYeah, I think this is going in a positive direction and I think this is a first very encouraging meeting. But again, in 45 minutes, you don\u2019t litigate all of the process and all of the issues and principles that we are talking about\u2026 Question:\n[Inaudible]\u2026Did he offer any assurances that he would change or moderate his tone in the campaign? House Speaker Paul Ryan:\nLook, I think it\u2019s important that the kind of conversation we had is between the two of us. And no offense, but I don\u2019t want to litigate our conversation through the media because I think when you\u2019re beginning to get to know someone, you have a good conversation of trust between each other. So I want to keep the things that we\u2019ve discussed between the two of us because they are very important and they are personal in some sense. And that means we talked about what it takes to unify, what our differences were and how we can bridge these gaps going forward so that we\u2019re strong as a party going into the fall. Question:\n[Inaudible]\u2026Did Mr. Trump reiterate his desire to see you as the chairman of the convention and is that a role that you still want? House Speaker Paul Ryan:\nHe did. I am the Speaker of the House. I am happy to serve in this capacity as the chair of our convention if our presumptive nominee wants me to do so. I see that as a \u2013 it\u2019s the delegates who typically make that decision. But I would honor the decision of our presumptive nominee and he did express that interest.  Question:\n[Inaudible]\u2026What did you think of his personality? House Speaker Paul Ryan:\nHis personality I thought he has a very good personality. He\u2019s a very warm and genuine person. As I said, I met him for like 30 seconds in 2012 so we really don\u2019t know each other. And we started to get to know each other. So I actually had a very pleasant exchange with him. That\u2019s point number one. Point number two, look, there are just things we really believe in as conservatives. We believe in limited government. We believe in the Constitution. We believe in the proper role of the differences in the separation of powers. We believe in things like life. I know we\u2019re \u2013 not everyone is pro-choice in our party and we accept all comers but we are a majority pro-life party. And these are things that are important to us. And so we just have a good exchange of views on these kinds of issues. I think he\u2019s over having the same conversation with the Senate right now. Our leaders met with him and everybody expressed opinions and exchanged ideas. And so the point of this is I think we\u2019re off to an encouraging start. It is important that we get ourselves to full strength so that we can win in the fall because the stakes could not be higher. But it takes more than 45 minutes\u2026 ", "name": "Transcript: House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s remarks after meeting with Donald Trump \u2013 Part 2"}, {"text": "Question:\n[Inaudible]\n House Speaker Paul Ryan:\nThat is true. We do want to beat Hillary Clinton. Question:\n[Inaudible]\u2026But that can\u2019t be the only point of unity here. You\u2019re having trouble passing the budget here in the House. What makes you think you can get on board with some of the things that Donald Trump is talking about when it comes to policy? House Speaker Paul Ryan:\nLet me say this: I think we had a very encouraging meeting. Look, it\u2019s no secret that Donald Trump and I have had our differences. We talked about those differences today. That\u2019s common knowledge. The question is what is it that we need to do to unify the Republican Party and all strains of conservative wings in the party? We had a very good and encouraging and productive conversation on just how to do that. It was important that we discussed our differences that we had. But it was also important that we discussed the core principles that ties us all together \u2013 principles like the Constitution, the separation of powers, the fact that we have an executive that is going way beyond the boundaries of the Constitution and how it\u2019s important to us that we restore Article I of the Constitution. You know, it\u2019s the principle of self-government. We talked about life and how strongly we feel about this core principle. We talked about the Supreme Court and things like this. I was very encouraged with what I heard from Donald Trump today. I do believe that we are now planting the seeds to get ourselves unified to bridge the gaps and differences. And so from here, we\u2019re going to go deeper into the policy areas to see where that common ground is and how we can make sure that we are operating off of these same core principles. And so yes, this is our first meeting. I was very encouraged with this first meeting. But this is a process. It takes a little time. You don\u2019t put it together in 45 minutes. And so that is why, like I said, we had a very good start to a process in how we unify.

I don\u2019t know. But I have ask you folks to explain the status of that. But he\u2019s done an amazing job and I think we\u2019re going to see something really, really fantastic. I also want to thank my staff, Paul, Cory, Pope. I mean, these people. What we\u2019ve been doing has been incredible. The work has been unreal. And Jared [Kushner], married to my daughter Ivanka. I mean, honestly, you know Jared is a very successful real estate person but I actually think he likes politics more than he likes real estate. I\u2019m excited. And he\u2019s very good at politics. So again folks this has been an amazing evening. I didn\u2019t expect this. I didn\u2019t expect it. And what Ted did is really a very brave thing to do and a great thing to do because we want to bring unity to the Republican Party. We have to bring unity. It\u2019s so much easier if we have it. And many, many people are calling that you wouldn\u2019t even believe \u2013 the media, the press, they wouldn\u2019t believe. People who have said the worst things about me \u2013 I\u2019ve never had things said about me like this. You know, with my businesses, I\u2019ve always been very respected. People didn\u2019t talk to me this way. But in politics, it\u2019s easy. The worst things and they\u2019re calling now and they\u2019re calling us all and they\u2019re saying, \u201cWe\u2019d love to get on the train\u201d \u2013 the \u201cTrump Train\u201d they call it \u2013 \u201cBut we\u2019d love to get on the team.\u201d And I actually spoke to one today who was vicious. I mean, this guy was unbelievable. And I said, \u201cI\u2019d love having you and I think it\u2019s terrific. But after what you said about me how can you possibly join our team?\u201d And he said, \u201cMr. Trump, don\u2019t even think about it. Don\u2019t worry about it. There\u2019ll be no problem.\u201d In other words, he\u2019s a politician; there\u2019s no problem. I would have had a hard time. But we have a lot of people coming \u2013 lots of congressmen. I have to thank Jeff Sessions \u2013 Sen. Jeff Sessions \u2013 one of the most respected men or people in Congress. And so many others. I mean, Sarah Palin has been from day one incredible. Jerry Falwell, Jr. Liberty University, I mean he is something. He is really a special person. They\u2019ve done an incredible job and everybody goes through Liberty. We all go through Liberty and somehow he liked what I was saying and perhaps he liked the way I said it. But he\u2019s a special guy and he really has helped. And so many pastors and ministers. And tonight, I see that I won with the evangelicals. The evangelical vote was for Trump. And there\u2019s no greater honor. No greater honor. We\u2019re going to work together for many, many years. We\u2019re going to make it so good. We\u2019re going to be saying Merry Christmas again. We\u2019re going to be saying it\u2026 And I won with women. I love winning with women. But I won with women. I won with men. We won with Hispanics. We won with African-Americans. We won with every \u2013 virtually every category. So it\u2019s just been an amazing evening. So again, I want to congratulate Ted Cruz. He is a tough, smart competitor. I want to thank my wife and my family. It\u2019s an incredible family. I want to thank my staff \u2013 both my staff and my thousands and thousands of people that work for the Trump organization, and perhaps in all fairness more importantly on this evening and for what we\u2019re doing currently, my staff where we\u2019re running for the presidency. And remember this. Our theme is very simple. It\u2019s make America great. We will make America great again. We will start winning again. You will be so proud of this country very, very soon.

But likewise they have to treat us fairly and they have to understand that what we\u2019ve been doing over the years has been so wrong and so unfair to the United States, to its people, and to its taxpayers. So that will change. And I will tell you, they\u2019re going to end up liking us better than they do right. They\u2019re going to respect us. In this building right upstairs, I have the largest bank in the world from China. The relationship is fantastic. We have great relationships with many foreign countries. But they have to respect us and they have to understand where we\u2019re coming from. And you know, it is a two-way street. And the two-way street means that we\u2019re going down one side and they\u2019re coming up the other.

If for some reason they want this system to continue the way it\u2019s going now, which is not fair and not good, where we\u2019re spending trillions and trillions of dollars probably $4 trillion in the Middle East. And we have to build our infrastructure, our roads. We have to rebuild our bridges, our airports, our hospitals in this country. We\u2019ve become close to a third world country. You look at some of our airports; it\u2019s third world. And then you go to other countries and you see places like you\u2019ve never seen. So I have to say that we are going to turn it around.

Now, one of the things that just happened, which to me is very exciting and it\u2019s happened now with two or three. But the Rasmussen poll came out yesterday and in that poll, I\u2019m now leading Hillary Clinton. A lot of good things\u2026 And that\u2019s going to continue because they\u2019re not going to be able to do it, folks. They\u2019re not going to be able to make great trade deals. We have such bad deals. They\u2019re not going to be able to do what we do with the military. They\u2019re not going to be able to do what we\u2019re going to do on the border, including the wall. We\u2019re going to have unbelievably great relationships with the Hispanics. The Hispanics have been so incredible to me. They want jobs. Everybody want jobs. The African-Americans want jobs. You look at what\u2019s going on. They want jobs. And we\u2019re going to bring back our jobs. We\u2019re going to save our jobs and people are going to have great jobs again.

We\u2019re not going to do it anymore. I want to thank and congratulate the Republican National Committee and Reince Priebus, who I just spoke to. He\u2019s doing a tremendous job. It\u2019s not an easy job when he had 17 egos and now I guess he\u2019s down to one.

And I called my people and I said, \u201cHow can we win? It\u2019s just constantly.\u201d It was the same as in Florida. You know, there\u2019ve been 60,000 negative ads. I got it right from you folks, okay? 60,000. In fact, two weeks ago it was 55,000. Now it\u2019s 60,000 negative ads \u2013 most of which are absolutely false and disgusting. And I said how can anybody endure this? I had one evening two nights ago where literally they had five ads on in between segments of a show that I was watching. And I said that\u2019s just incredible. And the people are so smart. They don\u2019t buy it. They get it. And it\u2019s tremendous, tremendous amounts of money were spent \u2013 millions and millions of dollars. And they were comparing it.

We\u2019re not going to be Hillary Clinton, and I watched her three or four weeks ago where she was talking about the miners as if they were just numbers and she was talking about she wants the mines closed and she will never let them work again. Let me tell you, the miners in West Virginia and Pennsylvania which was so great to me last week and Ohio and all over, they\u2019re going to start to work again. Believe me. You\u2019re going to be proud again to be miners. So we\u2019ll be going there. I must say this tremendous run that we\u2019ve had started with New York when we had almost 62%. And don\u2019t forget, that\u2019s with three people. So 62% with two people is a massive landslide. But 63% almost \u2013 just a little over 62% \u2013 when you have that kind of a number with three people, it\u2019s actually unheard of. And all throughout, it was 17 people, then 15, then 12, you know, it\u2019s tremendous, and we were getting very high numbers. And some of the numbers in my opinion that I got in the early stages were in a state with 32% but there were 14 people. I think that might actually be more and better than getting 62% in New York. But we never got the credit for that. But now we don\u2019t need the credit because we\u2019re going after Hillary Clinton. She will not be a great president. She will not be a good president. She will be a poor president. She doesn\u2019t understand trade. Her husband signed perhaps in the history of the world the single worst trade deal ever done. It\u2019s called NAFTA.

Now I\u2019ve known Syracuse and I\u2019ve known Poughkeepsie and I\u2019ve known all of the different places that I visited in New York and then Pennsylvania and then Maryland, which treated me so great the people are incredible.

I started as you know not very long ago \u2013 about six weeks ago \u2013 and I was told that I had a 20 point deficit. And I went there and I worked very hard and I campaigned and I made lots of speeches and met lots of incredible people \u2013 incredible people.

I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies. That\u2019s what we want. We want them to be our allies. We want the world to be \u2014 we want to bring peace to the world. Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons \u2013 the power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world. To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. Americans must know that we\u2019re putting the American people first again on trade. So true. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority. No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours, and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down\u2026 And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs. NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states \u2014 literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. And I\u2019ve just gotten to see it. I\u2019ve toured Pennsylvania. I\u2019ve toured New York. I\u2019ve toured so many of the states. They have been cleaned out. Their manufacturing is gone. Never again, only the reverse \u2014 and I have to say this strongly \u2014 never again; only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later. They fire the people. They take advantage of the United States. There will be consequences for those companies. Never again. Under a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country. I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America\u2019s greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are. The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest. America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again. And always \u2014 always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must \u2014 we have to and we will make America great again. And if we do that \u2014 and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO\u2019s outdated mission and structure grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism. I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win. I will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary \u2013 and I mean absolutely necessary \u2013 and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V. Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we\u2019ve had the exact opposite \u2014 a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy \u2013 one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake. After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever, ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster. I will also be prepared to deploy America\u2019s economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination. Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me. However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq \u2013 very proudly \u2013 saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very, very rich oil reserves \u2013 something it has wanted to do for decades. And now, to top it off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That\u2019s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people. We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in the New York Times or being watched on television. Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.

A great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute. A Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. Our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. These are our great people and we must treat them fairly. We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration. Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests. Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania \u2014 and this was a horrible time for us \u2014 were attacked, and 17 brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole. And what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade Organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States. Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaida. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn\u2019t do it. And then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America\u2019s core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities. In the Middle East our goals must be \u2013 and I mean must be \u2013 to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clear sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy. We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends. We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests. Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle \u2013 this horrible cycle \u2013 of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries. Some say the Russians won\u2019t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can\u2019t make a deal under my administration, a deal that\u2019s great \u2014 not good, great \u2014 for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It\u2019s as simple as that. We\u2019re going to find out. Fixing our relations with China is another important step \u2014 and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time. China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect. We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly \u2013 and I mean quickly \u2013 to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China \u2013 better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing it. No respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to have to happen.

There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There\u2019s no documentation. There\u2019s no paperwork. There\u2019s nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant. A pause for re-assessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and Sept. 11th \u2013 one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country \u2013 worse than Pearl Harbor. Because you take a look at what\u2019s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked \u2014 one of the true great catastrophes. And then there\u2019s ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won\u2019t tell them where and I won\u2019t tell them how. \u2026 We must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We\u2019re sending troops. We tell them. We\u2019re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now. But they\u2019re going to be gone. ISIS will be gone if I\u2019m elected president. And they\u2019ll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly. Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what\u2019s happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal \u2013 our ultimate deterrent \u2013 has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room. And what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25% from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted and we\u2019re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming. We will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned \u2013 and I mean unquestioned \u2013 by anybody and everybody. But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste. We\u2019re also going to have to change our trade, immigration, and economic policies to make our economy strong again and to put Americans first again. This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. So, so important. We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.

Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we\u2019re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won\u2019t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.\n\u2028Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. After Secretary Clinton\u2019s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible. Clinton blames it all on a video \u2013 an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation. And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil. And you know what? We don\u2019t blockade, we don\u2019t bomb, we don\u2019t do anything about it. It\u2019s almost as if our country doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening, which could be a fact and could be true. This will all change when I become president.

It\u2019s going to be a friend again. We\u2019re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies. We\u2019re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water\u2019s edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies. This is how we won the Cold War and it\u2019s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president. First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it\u2019s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War. In this, we\u2019re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been. \u2026We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It\u2019s now two-way. And remember, us and all we\u2019re doing, they have to appreciate what we\u2019ve done to them. We\u2019re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we\u2019ve done for them.

He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place. Israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region. President Obama has not been a friend to Israel. -He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we\u2019ve done \u2013 all of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.\n\u2028We\u2019ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they\u2019re starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good. Fourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they\u2019re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don\u2019t take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don\u2019t respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him. Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s called no respect. Absolutely no respect. Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth \u2014 fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip \u2014 unprecedented \u2014 comes in fourth place. He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times. The list of humiliations go on and on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China \u2013 economic power \u2013 and people don\u2019t understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control. He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We\u2019ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. They do at will. It always happens. If President Obama\u2019s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job. Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we\u2019ve lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day, we\u2019re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians. The next day, we\u2019re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. Lives lost, massive moneys lost. The world is a different place. We\u2019re a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess.

Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment. They have benefited so much \u2013 so sadly, for us. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy. First, our resources are totally over extended. President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He\u2019s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year. We\u2019re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem. I\u2019m the only one \u2014 believe me, I know them all \u2013 I\u2019m the only one who knows how to fix it. Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I\u2019ve been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so. They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2% of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia. The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice. The whole world would be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully. Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can\u2019t depend on us. We\u2019ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we\u2019ve never seen before in the history of our country. He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon. All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran\u2019s treatment of our ten captured sailors \u2014 so vividly I remember that day. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table. When the other side knows you\u2019re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win \u2014 you just can\u2019t win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. You\u2019ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place.

It\u2019s time to shake the rust off America\u2019s foreign policy. It\u2019s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold \u2013 something we have to do.

It has to be first. Has to be. That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make. America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of. In the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, \u201ctear down this wall\u201d. History will not forget what he did. A very special, special man and president. Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another. They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama\u2019s line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad.

But at a minimum, they\u2019re just not going to vote. Not going to vote. So how do you do this? How do you say, \u201cOkay, Trump won by 5 million votes. Trump is 500, 600 delegates more than Cruz and much more than that having to do with Kasich. And he brought millions of people into the party and everybody is talking about the party \u2013 worldwide how hot the Republican Party is.\u201d You know, some people used to say it\u2019s staid. The Democrats are 35% down from four years ago. The Republicans are almost 70% up from four years. And that\u2019s an amazing\u2026and that\u2019s not because of\u2026believe me, that\u2019s not because of Kasich or Cruz. That\u2019s because of me. So here\u2019s the thing: How do you say to them \u201cWe\u2019re going to choose a man that lost by 5 million votes and 500 delegates. We\u2019re going to take him because Trump was 14 delegates short of winning in the first ballot?\u201d I don\u2019t think you can do that. Now, with that being said, I intend to get enough delegates. But that\u2019s it. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n You look at the kind of crime. You look at what\u2019s going on economically. We need borders. And by the way, I want people to come into our country. But I want them to come in legally. They have to come in through a process. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d get 5% of the vote. The only thing she\u2019s got going is the woman\u2019s card, and the beautiful thing is women don\u2019t like her. Okay? And look how well I did with women tonight. Okay. So ladies and gentlemen, thank you, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.

President Obama said the biggest threat to our country is global warming. That\u2019s called give me a break. Okay? The biggest threat to our country is nuclear and we cannot let Iran get a nuclear weapon. We\u2019re going to do something where we\u2019ll have a real partnership with China. You know, we have a lot of power of China. China has re-built itself by making a fortune over us. China has power \u2013 tremendous power over North Korea. We have to be very vigilant on North Korea. We cannot let this guy go much further. And China should handle that problem. China can handle that problem very easily. They say they can\u2019t but they\u2019re toying with us. Okay? They\u2019re toying with us. We have a lot of power \u2013 we\u2019re going to have a great relationship with China. We\u2019re going to have a great relationship with Putin and Russia. But let me tell you, China has a lot of power over North Korea. A tremendous amount of power. They just refuse to use it and they refuse to talk about it and they\u2019re toying with us. And right now, they don\u2019t respect. They don\u2019t respect our president. And because of that, they\u2019re getting away with murder and this guy is getting away with murder. What\u2019s going to happen is \u2013 and something very important to me and to a lot of other people but very, very important to me \u2013 is nuclear weaponry. That is your single biggest threat in the world today. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Well, remember this, okay, I saw it on all the cable stations and a lot of the networks and I read it in a lot of papers, I\u2019ve had 55,000 negative ads against me. When I ran in Florida, I had 14,000 negative ads \u2013 millions and millions of dollars \u2013 and I won in a landslide. I\u2019ve had negative ads all throughout and I\u2019ve won races in a landslide. You know it, you report it. You all report it. I\u2019m not even \u2013 even Carl would agree to that. Right? I mean, landslides. \u2026Now, largely the ads were false. A little truth to some of them perhaps. But I had 55,000 \u2013 $100 million and maybe even more negative ads. Even in New Hampshire. I mean, Jeb spent millions and millions of dollars on negative ads and I won New Hampshire in a landslide. Now, what\u2019s happening is most of these people that have been fighting me are gone, and when I\u2019m one on one with Hillary, she will be as I said easier to take down, much easier to beat than the people \u2013 many of the people \u2013 that I\u2019ve already beaten.

I was asked the question recently by Wolf Blitzer on CNN and he talked about NATO. And I gave a great answer. I gave an answer that at first people didn\u2019t like and then they said, \u201cYou know what? Trump is right.\u201d Experts said. I said it\u2019s obsolete and too many people are getting a free ride because we\u2019re funding 72%, 73% of NATO. You know, 28 countries. And many of these countries are just taking advantage of the United States and you have to pay up because we don\u2019t have a country with $19 trillion in debt that can afford this anymore. You have to pay up. And part of what I\u2019m saying is people \u2013 we love our countries, we love our allies, but our allies can no longer be taken advantage of this country. This isn\u2019t 40 years ago and it\u2019s not 20 years ago. This is now. And we have to rebuild our infrastructure. We have to rebuild our country. We have get rid of ISIS and we have to get rid of them fast. Our military is totally depleted. We have to build it up. It\u2019s going to be the cheapest thing we can do. And a lot of great things are going to happen. We\u2019re going to make America great again. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And I have followed people for years and I have friends that are the most successful people in the world. Many of them are endorsing me. Carl Icahn, many of the great business people are endorsing me. You have to have flexibility. You can\u2019t say \u201cThis is my doctrine. I will not move\u201d because the world changes. Countries change. Leaders change. Lots of things happen. So you can\u2019t say that. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And again, the ceiling was always so unfair because\u2026I want to do it because it\u2019s so important. But the ceiling \u2013 they kept saying, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hit the 50%.\u201d Well, now they don\u2019t say that anymore. But how do you hit 50% when you have 16 people in the race? You can\u2019t do it. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n The biggest problem that students have \u2013 they have a problem with debt but they go to a good college. They borrow right up to here and they\u2019re choking on debt. And they graduate, they work hard, and they good marks and then they can\u2019t get a job. I\u2019m going to bring jobs back to this country like you\u2019ve never seen. That\u2019s the biggest problem. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Look, Hillary Clinton is funded by Wall Street, folks. I mean, she\u2019s going to get the nomination unless she gets herself indicted with respect to what\u2019s happening with the emails. Okay? You know, what I don\u2019t understand \u2013 you look at what\u2019s happened to so many other people and they went through hell. Their lives have been destroyed for doing less than what Hillary Clinton did. What she did is an outrage. It\u2019s an absolute criminal outrage. And for her to be able to run as a Democrat, that\u2019s why maybe Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t finished. But the only way you can say that is if something happens to her. She\u2019s being protected by the Democrats because what she did and I see it and whether I read about it in the papers or I watch it with experts \u2013 legal experts on television \u2013 virtually every single one of them said what she did is a criminal act and what she did is a very, very dangerous thing for our country. And yet, here she is running for president. So I think that Hillary Clinton, honestly, she\u2019s a flawed candidate and I think she\u2019s going to be easy to beat. I think she\u2019s going to be much easier to beat than most of the 16 people that I competed with just recently.

You know, I went to the best schools. I\u2019m like a very smart person. I\u2019m going to represent our country with dignity and very well. But I really don\u2019t want to change my personality. I think it got me here. Somebody said if you change and if you weren\u2019t that way then you wouldn\u2019t be maybe where you are right now. We beat a lot of people. A lot of people are sitting back saying, \u201cWhat happened, darling? Why are we sitting here? We\u2019re watching television.\u201d Don\u2019t forget, when I announced, there were many favorites that were going to win. One of those people raised over $100 million in a PAC and a lot of money personally. Others had other big advantages \u2013 governors of major states, et cetera, et cetera. They were all going to do great. They were all going to do great. One after another after another and here we stand with big five victories over 60%. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Her husband signed NAFTA which destroyed this country economically. I will tell you. You look at New York state, you look all over New England, you look at Pennsylvania, NAFTA was a disaster. Her husband signed it and it was a disaster for this country. Hillary will be horrible \u2013 absolutely horrible \u2013 on economic development. She will be terrible on jobs. She knows nothing about jobs except for jobs for herself. And when it came to answering the phone, when it came to answering the phone at 3 a.m., she was sleeping. Okay? She wasn\u2019t \u2013 with Benghazi and all of the other problems, you look at what she did with Syria. You look at what she\u2019s done in so many different ways. She will not be a good president. She doesn\u2019t have the strength. She doesn\u2019t have the stamina. I know about dealing with China. I\u2019ve made billions of dollars dealing with China. China can be dealt with and you can get along with them but Hillary does not have the strength or the stamina to deal with China or other things. But bottom line is one of the big problems our country has is problems with trade where you have China, Japan, Mexico, so many countries just ripping us left and right. The politicians cannot handle that problem. Two reasons. Number one, they don\u2019t have the competence to do it. Number two, most of them are paid off through campaign contributions so that they don\u2019t touch certain things that the people want touched. When people are making less money in real wages than they were 18 years ago, and then some people said \u201cWow, he had a big crowd\u201d, that\u2019s one of the big reasons. I mean, you have people making less money today as you know because you see every stat. Less money today than they made 18 years ago. And in some cases, they\u2019re working two jobs. So they\u2019re getting older and they\u2019re working harder. Shouldn\u2019t be that way. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n \u2026Including protecting our country because she will not be good with the military. She will not be good with protecting our country. And she\u2019s had her shot. And she also raised her hand when it came to Iraq and she shouldn\u2019t have voted. And if you remember, just take a look at the things that Bernie Sanders was saying about Hillary Clinton. He said she is not qualified to be president. But he said something else\u2026what\u2019s qualified? I mean, you\u2019ve got to go out, you\u2019ve got to run, and you see what happens. But he said some things about her that was so incredible. Incredible. And so incredibly bad. There\u2019s a great level of hatred right there but he\u2019s been telling the truth. And I really mean it. I think Bernie Sanders should run as an independent. I think he\u2019d do great. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Chris can tell you that. Ben Carson can tell you that. Other people can tell you that. I\u2019m getting calls \u2013 Cory can tell you. Paul can tell you. We have \u2013 we\u2019re getting calls from people who I actually say, \u201cHow can you do this? How can you do it?\u201d And they have no problem. But the fact is names that you wouldn\u2019t believe \u2013 names that you interview and say, \u201cOh, Trump, Trump, Trump\u201d and now they\u2019re calling to \u2013 they want to join the team.

Very capable people. Like Chris \u2013 governors, senators, Dr. Ben Carson, very smart, tough, highly accomplished people. 17 \u2013 a record in the history of politics. 17 people. So I go and I start winning, and I\u2019ll win New Hampshire, and I\u2019ll get whatever it may be \u2013 32% \u2013 and people would say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he get 50%?\u201d I said you can\u2019t get 50% when you have 16 people. Then I go to South Carolina; we have a massive victory. That was Cruz\u2019s stronghold except I won it in a landslide and I won it because of the evangelicals who backed me. The evangelicals have been unbelievable and they backed me. So I won there. And we had 12 or 13 or 14 people. We had many, many people, and I got a lot. And then we went to Nevada. We went to the south. I mean, Alabama with all of the people that we had, we almost got 50%. Massachusetts with all of the people that we had, we almost got 50%. The pundits \u2013 I was watching tonight \u2013 the pundits never talk about the fact that these early states \u2013 even now we have three. Three is unfair. You know, Hillary has one. I have three. There\u2019s a big difference between fighting one person and fighting two people in terms of percentages. So, what I\u2019m saying is when you talk about the 1,237 number, the first 70% of these things, we had from 16 people and even 17 people to 10 to 8 to 6 to 5 to 4 and now we\u2019re at 3. So it\u2019s really unfair when you try and \u2013 you know, I\u2019m always been very good at math. Nobody ever discusses. When I watch the people on television, whether it\u2019s CNN, Fox, or any of them, and I watch, they never talk about the fact that we have all these people and that if you got a 32% or a 35% or 38% and you have 7 people running, that\u2019s an unbelievable \u2013 that\u2019s like a 75%. So we are really honored by this night. And I am really honored to have hit over 60% in virtually every race with three people in the race\u2026 Question:\n[Inaudible]\n In fact, I heard that he had a news conference tonight and I heard the news conference was for the purpose that he\u2019s getting out of the race. That\u2019s what I thought. And instead, he just had a news conference. More talk.

Right? So I\u2019m not changing. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n You know, when I speak to a group of 10 people in a conference, I\u2019m not going to be speaking the same way I spoke in Pennsylvania yesterday to 25,000 people.

When we do that, all of a sudden, companies are going to say, \u201cI\u2019m staying in Syracuse, I\u2019m staying in Pennsylvania, and I\u2019m staying in Maryland.\u201d And I want to thank the people of Maryland. They\u2019ve been so incredible. We had some rallies all over but we had some rallies in Maryland and Pennsylvania that were absolutely unbelievable. Yesterday, in Pennsylvania we were in an arena that was like Madison Square Garden. They turned away thousands and thousands of people. Unfortunately, the press never reports that. They always show my face. They go like this. I said, \u201cDoes anybody ever want to show this arena that\u2019s got tens of thousands of people in it?\u201d But they don\u2019t do that. But that\u2019s okay because I\u2019ll let the news explain it to you. But we\u2019re going to have our country back. We\u2019re going to make America great again. And I just want to tell you for the five states, I am so honored. This was to me our biggest night because it shows such diversity. So thank you very much, and we will take some questions. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Now, I\u2019m not saying everybody \u2013 some people have gone too far over the edge. But we will have people backing the party and backing the presidency, and we\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to beat Hillary Clinton, and it\u2019s not even\u2026[inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And one of the things with Pennsylvania. You know, we had a massive victory. 60% \u2013 above 60%. Pennsylvania is amazing. We get 17 delegates outright, and then you have 54 or so delegates that are, you know, up for grabs. The one thing different with Pennsylvania and I\u2019ve heard about it for years actually is that the winner of Pennsylvania, there\u2019s a moral obligation at least on the first round to support the person that won. Now, we didn\u2019t only win, we won big. And again we have to get in mind \u2013 you have the three people and when you have three people to get 60%, that\u2019s almost unheard of. Honestly, if you had two people and you got 60%, that\u2019s a really big victory. So here you have a case where we have a great leader \u2013 a great Republican leader \u2013 and you have a moral obligation in Pennsylvania that those people \u2013 and all I care about is the first round. You know, when you people write about Cruz is going around giving people dinner, buying people everything, riding them around all over the place, getting them into hotel rooms because he\u2019s looking for the second and third and the fourth, I\u2019m not really too interested in that because we\u2019re going to win on the first. I\u2019m not looking to go second, third, fourth. Maybe I\u2019m making a mistake. The truth is even if this did ever go there, can you imagine if Donald Trump \u2013 because in California, we\u2019re up to almost 50%, I think we hit 50% today \u2013 and they\u2019re at 18% and 16% so we\u2019re going to have a big California. I think we\u2019re going to do great in Indiana. Indiana is the home of Carrier Air Conditioning, which is leaving for Mexico that I\u2019ve been talking about for the last four months \u2013 long before I knew Indiana would be so important. And I\u2019m saying that won\u2019t happen if I\u2019m president. Carrier will not be leaving Indiana if I\u2019m president. But I\u2019ve been talking about this for a long period of time.

Why is he here? I can tell you that if you look, Dr. Ben Carson did much better. He could have hung around and done very well. If you look, Chris Christie did much better. If you look, Marco Rubio did much better. In fact, Marco Rubio right now has more delegates than, you know, Kasich. I mean, he\u2019s got more delegates. But so many others \u2013 all they had to do was hang around. But they thought that was inappropriate and a lot of people don\u2019t like seeing it. It\u2019s like a spoiled person that just says, \u201cI\u2019m just staying\u201d for whatever reason. So, Kasich \u2013 and by the way, as soon as Kasich gets hit with the first negative ad, he\u2019s had none, bing! That\u2019s the end of that. You know, it\u2019s the only thing he can say. And today, we came up even against Hillary but we will beat Hillary so easily. And you know, remember this: I was not going to run according to everybody and I ran. I was not going to sign form A, which basically you sign your life away, and I signed form A. And then everybody starts saying, \u201cWow.\u201d And then we put in financials and the financials were phenomenal \u2013 a little bit like this evening \u2013 far better than even people thought. Great financials. I built a great company with the help of my sons and my daughters. I mean, with the help of my family, frankly, and it\u2019s been great. But we\u2019ve built a great, great company. And then everybody said again, \u201cWell, he\u2019s just going to have a good time for a couple of weeks. He\u2019s enjoying it.\u201d And very shortly, we went to number one over a three or four week period and we\u2019ve been there ever since. We\u2019ve been number one ever since. And again, millions of more votes, hundreds of more delegates. And I think this one is maybe the biggest of them all and in New York last week at almost 62% was incredible \u2013 far better than what people thought. They said if you can break 50% \u2013 again with three people it\u2019s very hard to break 50% \u2013 we had almost 62%. Picked up so many delegates. Last week, we had 95 delegates in New York state, New York City. The whole thing added up to 95. We picked up almost every single one of them. It was an amazing victory. But this one\u2019s a diverse victory. I mean, you go Rhode Island, then you go Maryland, then you go Connecticut, and you go Pennsylvania, and you go \u2013 I mean, the whole thing \u2013 Delaware. And every one of them was conclusive and every state is so different. I mean, it\u2019s so different. I think one of the greats was when you look at almost 50% in Massachusetts and almost 50% in the state of Alabama. Now, that\u2019s pretty different and we have all across the board. And I think we\u2019re going to do really well in Washington state and I think we\u2019re going to do amazingly well in Oregon and every place we\u2019re going to. I mean, we\u2019re going to be going \u2013 fighting hard \u2013 New Mexico. We\u2019re going to be fighting really hard. And I think that Gov. Kasich and Sen. Cruz have really, really hurt themselves with a faulty deal that was defaulted on before they even started\u2026 So what it is is politicians \u2013 all talk, no action. They can\u2019t get it done. And they certainly can\u2019t straighten out our country because we\u2019re going to bring back jobs. We\u2019re going to take care of our military. We\u2019re going to be doing so many things.  I mean, for me, especially over the last two weeks because I traveled New York state and I went to Syracuse and Poughkeepsie and Rome \u2013 this Rome, our Rome. Rome, New York as opposed to \u2013 there\u2019s another Rome out there some place. But we went to Rome, New York. And we went to the island \u2013 Bethpage. Just every place we went \u2013 manufacturing down 40% to 45% and even more. And then we go to Pennsylvania and we see the same thing. You look at what\u2019s happening with steel. You look at what\u2019s happening in so many other industries. And I get statisticians to give me the numbers before I leave all the time. Give me the numbers. And every single place I go is a disaster. Manufacturing down 40%, 45%, 55%, 60% sometimes in a relatively short period of time. Our jobs are being sucked away from our country and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore, folks. We\u2019re going to make it very, very difficult to do that. And when companies want to leave this country, our great country, and they want to lay off all these people that in many cases helped build the country, there will be consequences for that company to pay when they think they\u2019re going to make their product and send it in no taxes through a very weak border \u2013 which by the way, our border will be very, very strong, and we will build the wall. Just remember I said it. Okay? But when they think they\u2019re going to send their product right through this weak border and they\u2019re going to pay no tax and have absolutely no consequence for what they did, it\u2019s not going to happen that way.

I got a call at 11 p.m. and we talked and I said, \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing because it shows weakness. It shows ineffectiveness. It shows failing campaign. But really it\u2019s collusion.\u201d In business, they put you in jail for collusion. In politics, you\u2019re allowed to get away with it. But it really is \u2013 I thought it was a very weak signal and the Republican Party needs something much different than that. We\u2019ll be going to\u2026Indiana. I\u2019ll be leaving tomorrow afternoon for just a long stay. It\u2019s a great state. I have many, many friends there. And I have a coach \u2013 Bobby Knight. The great Bobby Knight\u2026Bobby\u2019s an amazing guy. He\u2019s tough. He\u2019s sharp. He\u2019s smart. And he wins. He knows how to win. And the people of Indiana love him and Bobby\u2019s endorsed me. And we\u2019re going to spend tomorrow night and I think the next day with Bobby. So it\u2019s going to be a lot of excitement and fun and that\u2019s call the gold standard. For Indiana, I think Bobby Knight has to be the gold standard. And we have so many other people that have endorsed us there so that will be great. So we\u2019ll be spending \u2013 we\u2019ll start in the afternoon and we\u2019ll be spending numerous days in Indiana and it\u2019s going to be something really, really special. So, I want to thank the media. The media has covered me very fair for the last two hours. No, they\u2019ve been very fair over the last few weeks. And you know, it\u2019s been amazing what\u2019s been happening. The crowds that we\u2019ve had are record-setting crowds. Bigger than Bernie. But Bernie\u2019s second, I have to say. In fact, I suggested today \u2013 you probably saw that \u2013 the Democrats have treated Bernie very badly and frankly I think he should run as an independent. Okay? I actually \u2013 I think they\u2019ve treated him very badly. I mean, you know, the system is a bad system, and whether it\u2019s their system or our system, you look at what goes on. But the best way to beat the system is have evenings like this where you get record-setting votes, where you get record-setting delegates. I used the analogy of the boxer. You know, when the boxer knocks out the other boxer, you don\u2019t have to wait around for a decision. So that\u2019s what it is. That\u2019s what happened tonight. That\u2019s what happened last week in New York. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s been happening throughout. We have millions more votes \u2013 millions more \u2013 than Cruz. We have millions more votes than Kasich. I mean, Kasich now I guess he was 1 in 41.

And I just can\u2019t wait. So, we don\u2019t have much of a race anymore based on what I\u2019m seeing on television. Sen. Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated. And we\u2019ve won another state. As you know, we have won millions of more votes than Sen. Cruz. Millions and millions of more votes than Gov. Kasich. We\u2019ve won and now especially after tonight close to 300 delegates more than Sen. Cruz. We\u2019re really, really rocking. We expect we\u2019re going to have an amazing number of weeks because these are places and they\u2019re in trouble. They\u2019re in big trouble. When you look at Pennsylvania. When you look at Indiana. When you look at Maryland and Rhode Island and so many places, we have problems everywhere you look. We are going to solve those problems. And one of the big problems is the economy and jobs, and that is my wheelhouse. So again, I want to thank everybody. It\u2019s really nice to win the delegates with the votes. You know? It\u2019s really nice. Nobody should be given delegates, which is a ticket to victory and it\u2019s not a fair ticket. And even though we\u2019re leading by a lot and we can\u2019t be caught \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to catch us \u2013 nobody should take delegates and claim victory unless they get those delegates with voters and voting. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. And you watch. Because the people aren\u2019t going to stand for it. It\u2019s a crooked system. It\u2019s a system that\u2019s rigged. And we\u2019re going to go back to the old ways called you vote and you win. So we\u2019ll be going to the convention no matter what happens and I think we\u2019re going to go in so strong. And over the next number of weeks, we just saw a poll come out of California, which is an unbelievable poll. But we\u2019re going to go into the convention, I think, as the winner. But nobody can take an election away with the way they\u2019re doing it in the Republican Party. And by the way, I am no fan of Bernie. But I\u2019ve seen Bernie win, win, win, and then I watch and they say he has no chance of winning. So they have their super delegates. The Republican system is worse. So I want to just thank everybody. I have great, great admiration and praise for the city of New York and the state of New York. I can think of nowhere that I would rather have this victory. So we love you all. Have a great evening. We celebrate. And tomorrow morning, we go back to work. I\u2019m flying tomorrow morning. I\u2019m flying tomorrow morning to Indiana. I\u2019m going to Pennsylvania. I will be all over. So we\u2019re going to celebrate for about two hours. Then early in the morning I get up and we begin working again. Thank you everybody!

And I\u2019d go around and I\u2019d see the people of New Hampshire, and they tell me, \u201cMr. Trump, our biggest problem is heroin.\u201d I said, \u201cHeroin?\u201d It doesn\u2019t make sense. You know, you look at the beautiful trees or the woods or the roadways and the lakes. I said, \u201cHeroin?\u201d It just doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s incongruous. Right? It doesn\u2019t work.

They come right in.\u201d Now, New Hampshire rated it their number one problem. They have a tremendous problem. But many other communities, including you, but many other communities have this problem. We\u2019re going to stop it cold, folks. We\u2019re going to stop it cold. And the bottom line is this.

We love the country. \u2026I love you too. Thank you. Really do. I love the people. I love the people. You know, they say Donald Trump \u2013 my base is so strong. They say, \u201cDonald Trump can do almost anything.\u201d In fact, one person today said \u201cAnything\u201d. And they interviewed a woman, I saw her last night on television sitting in a hotel room, which was not the most beautiful room I\u2019ve ever been. It was very clean, and I only want clean. I don\u2019t care about the room. I want clean. But they were sitting there and they said to a woman \u2013 a wonderful woman, probably 55 years old, and her friends were there. And they said, \u201cWhat would it take to get you to vote for somebody other than Donald Trump?\u201d She said, \u201cDon\u2019t play that game. There\u2019s nothing he can do that would get me to vote against him.\u201d And I wanted to go up and I wanted to hug that television set. I wanted to \u2013 I wish I could find out who she is.

He gets everything he wants. I mean, you look at the omnibus budget from three months he got everything he wanted \u2013 fund Obamacare, bring people into the country that shouldn\u2019t be here. He got everything he wanted. So he is the worst negotiator worldwide. We have Sergeant [Bowe] Bergdahl. Right? We get Bergdahl, a traitor. No, no, think of it. This is a negotiation. We get Bergdahl. And they get \u2013 what do they get? Five of their most coveted killers that have been in jail for eight years in Gitmo, which we\u2019re not closing down by the way. Okay? We\u2019re going to run it. So we get Bergdahl, a traitor, who five or six \u2013 probably six \u2013 people were killed going out to try and get him back. He left. He\u2019s a traitor. So we get Bergdahl, and that\u2019s what we get. And they get five people that are right now back on the battlefield or soon to be back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody in sight, including us. Okay? We\u2019ve got to stop it.

Japan is very concerned with North Korea. You know, number one, I like the way it is now but I want them to pay a lot more money. They probably will. But if they don\u2019t, it\u2019s not so bad if they are at heads. Maybe we\u2019re not supposed to get into that fight. That\u2019s a bad fight. Maybe we\u2019re not supposed to. Okay? Okay? Same thing with South Korea. I mean, every time he raises his head and he starts talking, every single time he raises his head, our ships start floating over, our planes start going over. We do all sorts of exercise. What are we get out of this? We have 28,000 soldiers on the line. So, we have to be taken care of. Now, I\u2019m talking as a person financially. Okay? I\u2019m also talking militarily. But I\u2019m talking financially. We don\u2019t have a country that can do this anymore.

Somebody else would have it, probably maybe Iraq because he would have come back. And by the way, speaking of that, you know, I was against going into Iraq. Everyone says, \u201cOh, Trump is going to be very tough.\u201d I was against going into Iraq from the very beginning, from the very beginning. And I\u2019m going to build our military bigger, stronger than ever before. But you know what? Hopefully, we never have to use it. Nobody\u2019s going to tell us what to do though. We have to shape it up because our military is totally depleted. But if our politicians would have gone to the beach for the last number of years, many years, we would be much stronger in a sense. We\u2019d be much stronger because the Middle East is a disaster. You see the great migration. It\u2019s a catastrophe. You see what\u2019s going on in Germany. It\u2019s a total mess.

So it comes out\u2026I said, look, I would have to tell Japan and I\u2019m talking about other nations also because I have great friends from Japan, I have great friends from South Korea. We have to go see them, go to talk to, have a meeting with them, \u201cWe love protecting you.\u201d We don\u2019t want them to arm necessarily.

And here\u2019s what the\u2026I was telling the people and they said \u201cWow, that sounds good.\u201d We\u2019ve got to take \u2013 you\u2019ve got to take care of us. Now, they\u2019ll probably say initially \u201cNo\u201d. And then we leave and then they\u2019re going to say, \u201cYes.\u201d But if they don\u2019t say yes, you always have to be prepared to make a great deal to walk. You have to be\u2026 The problem with the Iran deal was that Secretary Kerry was like an amateur. Call him amateur night. He refused to walk. They were laughing at him in the streets of Iran. They were claiming the deal was the greatest deal ever made before it was even made. They were saying \u201cThis deal is unbelievable.\u201d They were laughing at the Secretary of State of this country. They were laughing at the United States saying that this deal is great. And they were dancing. Remember? Burning the flag dancing? When they start dancing about a deal that I\u2019m making, when they start burning the American flag, I\u2019m out of there. Bye bye. Good luck. And he just kept going back. And I kept waiting. I wanted to call him. I wanted to call him. I wanted to say, \u201cWalk.\u201d Because every single thing \u2013 he\u2019d say, \u201cWe would like to get this.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cOh, okay. You\u2019ve got it. We would like to get that.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d You know, the Persians are great negotiators. It\u2019s an unbelievable deal. But just yesterday, Obama just yesterday he brought it up that he\u2019s very unhappy. I mean, think of it. Think of it. $150 billion. It\u2019s the worst deal. We didn\u2019t get our prisoners back. We should have had the prisoners back before we started negotiating. Increase the sanctions. Don\u2019t sit at the table. Say \u201cYou give our prisoners back or we\u2019re not starting.\u201d You leave. They\u2019ll say \u201cNo\u201d. You leave. And what happens? You double up the sanctions. Within 24 hours, they call you and they say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got your prisoners.\u201d That could have been years ago. Right? So we have people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. Here\u2019s the story. You need Trump. You do. You need Trump. You bet\u2026You do. I mean, you\u2019ve got to have Trump. I mean, it\u2019s sort of interesting because I see when I turn on the television, I see these ads about myself by crooked people. I see these ads and they\u2019re mostly wrong. A little bit sometimes are right but they\u2019re all negative. You know. And I\u2019m looking, I\u2019m watching this on television \u2013 ad after ad. In Florida, they spent $38 million on negative ads and I won it in a landslide\u2026Does anybody read? Does anybody watch television? You know, it\u2019s not much for the advertising community when you think they spent $38 million \u2013 a record number in Florida. They spent thousands and thousands of ads nationwide \u2013 listen to this one \u2013 55,000 negative ads on me. Most of them was made up. I\u2019ll give you one good example. We have the Club for Growth, which is forget them. These are among the dumbest people that you\u2019ll ever meet. They come to my office. They want me to give them $1 million. A friend asked me, \u201cPlease see them.\u201d I said, \u201cWho are they?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re Club for Growth.\u201d Whatever that means. So they come to my office. They asked me for $1 million. I say, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d And that\u2019s it.

But when you have free trade, you need smart people running your side of the free trade. If you don\u2019t have smart people or if you have people like Ted Cruz that are totally controlled by the people that give him the money and they\u2019re controlled by the establishment. I mean, look at the establishment. This guy in his whole life didn\u2019t know what the word establishment meant. Now you have all these people going because they said, \u201cOh man, Trump is terrible. He doesn\u2019t want any of our money.\u201d I had one friend that came into my office \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said this before. He came into my office. He wanted to give me millions of dollars. I said, \u201cI can\u2019t take your money. I don\u2019t want your money. I\u2019m self-funding.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no, no, you\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d He didn\u2019t even know. He thought I was kidding. He wanted to endorse me, wanted to support me. I said no, no, I don\u2019t want. Anyway, he was finally convinced that I didn\u2019t want his money and he\u2019s leaving. And I said, \u201cBy the way, what are you going to do now?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m going to give it to another candidate.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d They\u2019re gamblers. They have to do it. It\u2019s like almost a disease. They have to do it. It\u2019s the craziest thing. He loves me. He wants to give give me probably close to $10 million. Right? I would have had the greatest Super PAC in the history if I would have taken all the money. And my whole life, you know, I\u2019ve said this before, my whole life as a business person is this. Right? It\u2019s okay. Nothing wrong with it. I take. I keep taking. I take and take. But now I\u2019m going to take for the United States. We\u2019re going to take. We\u2019re not going to be the stupid people anymore. We\u2019re not going to be the stupid people anymore. We can\u2019t be. We can\u2019t be. And with NATO when they don\u2019t pay, you know, I said \u2013 I was asked a question by Wolf Blitzer, a very fair question about NATO. Now, you know, I\u2019ve been a businessman. World class. I filed my business papers. They were phenomenal. Everybody says great, great, great. I built a great company. Very little debt. Tremendous cash flow. Some of the greatest assets in the world. And I tell you that only for one reason \u2013 that\u2019s the thinking we need in Washington. We need some of that thinking. And Wolf Blitzer asked me a question on television. He said, \u201cLet me just ask you about NATO.\u201d Now, I haven\u2019t been asked about NATO a lot but I understand NATO and I understand common sense, and I\u2019m like a smart person like many of the people in this room. Hopefully all of the people in this room. But he asked me about NATO. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s obsolete.\u201d This was my first thing. And you know what? I\u2019m the first one. Guys that study NATO and good people but they study NATO and they say, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. What he just said, I never thought of it.\u201d They study it because they\u2019re so into it that they don\u2019t realize because it was really put there. You had the Soviet Union and now you have Russia, which is different but Russia is powerful so we could sort of say that\u2019s a balance. So we\u2019ll leave it. But it doesn\u2019t really cover terrorism like it\u2019s supposed to. Doesn\u2019t have the right countries. I mean, many of the countries and there aren\u2019t \u2013 that you associate with terrorism. And so I said number one, it\u2019s obsolete. I said number two, to the best of my knowledge, the United States pay far too much proportionately and why are we always paying the bills to protect other people? And the press, which is so totally dishonest, the press goes \u2013 headlines the next day \u2013 \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want NATO, wants to disband NATO\u201d. And that\u2019s not what I said. I said, you\u2019ve got to pay your bills. And you know what? If you can\u2019t pay your bills, honestly, there should be \u2013 they\u2019ve got to go because we can\u2019t do it. You know, this isn\u2019t 68 years ago. This isn\u2019t when it was originally formed like many, many years ago, many decades ago, and you have to re-do things. But it is interesting. Some of the smartest people have said \u201cWhat Trump said is genius. It\u2019s obsolete. And you know what? It\u2019s true.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of people, a lot of countries being given a free ride. We can\u2019t have the free rides any more, folks. \u2026Thank you. Well, we need somebody with that\u2026And it\u2019s America first, folks. It\u2019s America first. So then, as you know, North Korea is a big problem. North Korea is a problem. A problem that could be solved easily by China but they don\u2019t want to solve it because they want to tweak us. They\u2019re building in the South China Seas a massive military fort. You know what\u2019s going on. They shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And they\u2019re taking our money and, you know, you talk about the imbalance of trade, you talk about the kind of money. How about this? We owe China $1.7 trillion. Now, they take our money. They take our jobs\u2026I\u2019m not angry at China. I\u2019m angry at our people and our leaders for letting it happen. I\u2019m not angry with China. If you can get away with it, you do it. But they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our money. They take everything. We owe them $1.7 trillion. That\u2019s sort of like a magic act. Doesn\u2019t it? Amazing. Japan, they send cars by the millions. They come off those boats. Los Angeles \u2013 I was there at the docks. I looked at the biggest boats you\u2019ve ever seen. Biggest, greatest ships you\u2019ve ever seen. The cars are pouring off the ships. We owe them $1.5 trillion.

Even in Wisconsin, I mean, you see the jobs, the manufacturing, it\u2019s all so down and so gloomy and throughout the United States. And it\u2019s a disaster what\u2019s going on in our country. We\u2019re not going to have jobs left. And they do it with manipulation of currency. And they do it with guile. They do it with so many different elements that our people don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening. Our politicians in most cases don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening. And when they do know what\u2019s happening and they let it happen, it\u2019s even worse. So I\u2019m not taking money from anybody. I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. And we\u2019re going to get it. We\u2019re going to get it. Now, I look at this U.S. manufacturing \u2013 I mean, just look at this. Look at these charts. I mean, you can see them\u2026This is where we\u2019re going. You know that\u2019s not good. Right? This is where we\u2019re going. There was one that I just saw. Just got this. It\u2019s like incredible. Look at this. This is U.S. manufacturing jobs rapidly decline since year 2000. Look at that chart. Another couple of years, there won\u2019t be any jobs. And the jobs we have now are bad jobs. These are bad jobs. These aren\u2019t good jobs. And everybody admits that. Even the other side says, \u201cWe agree. They\u2019re bad jobs.\u201d And the number that they talk about when they say 5% unemployment \u2013 it\u2019s a fictitious number. When you stop looking for a job, you\u2019re considered statistically employed. It was a number that was made up years ago probably by president but certainly by politicians to make them look good, to make them look really good like the economy. The economy is not good. The economy is bad. We\u2019re sitting on a bubble. The banks have money. They give it to you for nothing if you\u2019re rich. If you\u2019re not rich, that\u2019s when you need the money, they don\u2019t loan it to you. So the people can\u2019t do jobs. Probably here you have some great companies, some really good smaller companies, you can\u2019t get the banks to give you money. The banks are controlled by the regulators. They system that this country is run under is out of control. And we\u2019re going to change it. We\u2019re going to bring back the jobs. We\u2019re going to bring back our companies. And you know I\u2019ve had such a response. And the reason I\u2019ve had response is because of that and then I look at the ads today. I\u2019m in hotel and I look at the ads and Cruz makes up these ads. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring back jobs\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s using my same language. Here\u2019s the problem. They don\u2019t know where to begin. They don\u2019t know where to begin. And if they did, Lyin\u2019 Ted, lyin\u2019, he comes up. Did you ever see a guy like this? Just look what he did with Ben Carson. Ben Carson, who endorsed me by the way, is a great guy, and Lyin\u2019 Ted, remember in Iowa, he said \u201cBen has left the race. He\u2019s left the race.\u201d This was on election day. It\u2019s not like two days before or the day after. \u201cDuring the election, he left the race.\u201d Okay? And people believed him and thousands of votes were cast not for Ben but for Ted Cruz. It\u2019s pure deception. It\u2019s lying. And then there were many other things. And actually during one of the debates, Marco Rubio looked over and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou know, I never heard a politician call another politician liar so we can do it.\u201d So we now call him Lyin\u2019 Ted \u2013 Lyin\u2019. It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s crazy. I mean, what he does and what he says is just terrible. And you know, I\u2019ve met a lot tougher people but I\u2019ve never met any human that lied as much as him. And he comes in and you noticed the tremendous evangelical support I have? I have Jerry Falwell Jr. from Liberty University. I have all of these people. I have such incredible support. And the evangelicals \u2013 he thought he was going to get the evangelicals but they don\u2019t like liars and they see he lies so much. Do you ever see him \u2013 he walks up and he walks in with the Bible, held high. Right? Held high and then he starts to lie. Boy, he is bad. So anyways, I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to fall for that. I really don\u2019t think that anybody is going to fall \u2013 he doesn\u2019t talk. He debates\u2026I said, \u201cTed, take it easy. Just talk. Talk. Talk.\u201d But we\u2019re doing really well. The whole thing is just working out. And I loved being here. You know, I\u2019ve been here for a long time. I\u2019ve been here for a long time. I\u2019m going here \u2013 we\u2019re going to stay tomorrow. We\u2019re going to have some, I think I\u2019m doing Fox and Friends tomorrow morning. I\u2019m doing some shows tomorrow.

And it\u2019s a movement of intelligence, actually. It\u2019s a movement of common sense. That\u2019s all it is.

Take me in for heaven\u2019s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,\u2019 cried the broken snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk and then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. Now she hurried home from work that night. As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she\u2019d taken in had been revived. \u2018Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in for heaven\u2019s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,\u2019 sighed the broken snake.

That\u2019s what\u2019s happening to our country, folks. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening to our country and we can\u2019t let it happen. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant. We have to be strong. And if we\u2019re not, we\u2019re not going to have a country. And we need borders and we\u2019re going to have borders. And we need great trade deals and we\u2019re going to make great trade deals. And we can\u2019t let Mexico and I have great respect for Mexico and I respect their leaders but we can\u2019t let Mexico and China and any country you want to name steal our business, steal our jobs. When you look at what\u2019s happening in Wisconsin \u2013 and you see it \u2013 the reason I beat your governor and I beat him badly was I just read off the statistics. I just read \u2013 all I did, I stood up and I read statistics. You\u2019re losing jobs\u2026It\u2019s very average. It\u2019s very average. Our country is less than average. Okay? Our country is doing so badly. And it\u2019s just one of those things and we have to smarten up and we have to get really tough. We have to get so, so, so vigilant and not be so politically correct. We have to do what\u2019s right for our country. When the great Ford Motor Company \u2013 great company \u2013 when they build a $2.5 billion plant in Mexico, when Nabisco moves its massive plant to Mexico from Chicago, we can\u2019t let it happen. When Carrier Air Conditioners, as you know, they just announced they\u2019re moving to Mexico. Pfizer is moving to Ireland. But let me just tell you. So, I watched the politicians and they have no business instincts. But more importantly, they\u2019re taken care of. You know, a lot of friends come up to me and they say, \u201cDonald, let me ask you a question. These politicians \u2013 are they really that dumb?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, they\u2019re not actually that dumb. Some are. But they\u2019re not actually that dumb. They\u2019re all taken care of by the special interests. And when you want something done, you see certain people in Washington.\u201d Hey, who is better than me? I mean, take a look at me. I was before June 16th, I was a part of the establishment and they will do not what\u2019s right for you but they will do what\u2019s right for the company they represent or the country they represent and the United States continues to get ripped off, ripped off, ripped off. And a lot of times, I\u2019ll say, \u201cHow can a deal be so stupidly made? These people are so stupid.\u201d They\u2019re not stupid. They\u2019re doing it for themselves. They\u2019re doing it because they want campaign contributions. They\u2019re doing it because they want money put in their PACs. They are totally controlled by the money. Believe me. They are totally controlled by the money, and that\u2019s not good for our country. Okay? That\u2019s not good because terrible things are happening and we\u2019re getting weaker and weaker.

That\u2019s a sign of affection, and it\u2019s a sign of respect, and I really do appreciate it. That\u2019s really nice. So we have to bring our country back and so many different things. With China, we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year. With Mexico, we will build a wall. We will have strong borders. Strong borders. Believe me. We have a trade deficit of $58 billion a year. The wall\u2019s going to cost $10 billion to build. And people, the politicians are saying, \u201cHow can you possibly get them to pay?\u201d Let me tell you something, folks. We have some good business people in this audience. When you have a $58 billion deficit, and you have a $10 billion wall, that\u2019s real easy. And that\u2019s on a yearly basis the $58 billion. It\u2019s really easy. And they don\u2019t understand it. They said, \u201cHow are you going to get them to pay?\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s so easy.\u201d And you understand it. Just rely on me. Okay? Rely. So easy. That\u2019s so easy. And we\u2019re going to have a strong border. You know, two days ago I was greatly honored because the Border Patrol, the folks that do a great job, and they\u2019re told to stand back but they don\u2019t want to stand back. They want to do their job properly. They\u2019re proud people. They\u2019re incredible people. Frankly, before the wall goes up, we might not even need the wall, but we\u2019re building it anyway. Okay? We\u2019re building it. Believe me. But the Border Patrol people are unbelievable people, and its 15,500 people gave me an endorsement two days ago. And I didn\u2019t ask for it. I didn\u2019t know. First time, first time they\u2019ve ever done it. Right? First time, they\u2019ve ever done it and they gave me an endorsement. And it\u2019s so important. Now, Sheriff Joe [Arpaio] from Arizona. You know, I won Arizona very big, and Sheriff Joe was with me and it was incredible and we love it. Look, we have to have strong borders. We can\u2019t let the Syrians come in that we have no idea who they are, where they\u2019re coming from. We don\u2019t know if they\u2019re Syrians. This could be the all-time great Trojan horse. Who knows? I have as big a heart as anybody. We want to help them. We want to build safe zones in Syria. I want to get the Gulf States to pay for it. The Gulf States have nothing but money. We don\u2019t have money. We will run it. We will do a good job. We\u2019ll get it done but let somebody else pay for it for a change. We can\u2019t do it. \u2026I keep getting these requests. You know, Al Green \u2013 the great Al Green wrote \u201cThe Snake\u201d. How many people have heard \u201cThe Snake\u201d? How many people? Oh, do you want to hear \u201cThe Snake\u201d? Do you want to hear it? I mean, people love it and I love it because it says what\u2019s going to happen to us if we\u2019re not careful. And this really pertains to allowing people into our country that we know are going \u2013 we\u2019re going to have problems. We\u2019re going to have huge problems. Allowing people in from areas of the world we don\u2019t know where they come from. We don\u2019t know where their documents are. They say they don\u2019t have documents. They have no papers. No nothing. We let them in. How stupid can we be? So this is called \u201cThe Snake\u201d and I think it\u2019s pretty good. All right? Are you ready for this? A couple of you have heard it but some of you haven\u2019t.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. But you know what? If we have to live with him, we still beat him easily. Okay, folks? I mean, okay? But Kasich voted for NAFTA. NAFTA was a disaster for Wisconsin and it was a disaster for our country. Ted Cruz wants TPP and it is going to make NAFTA look like peanuts. What they\u2019re doing to us with those documents, and Cruz is the one that insisted that we can\u2019t talk about money manipulation, which is devaluation of currencies in the agreement. He wouldn\u2019t let them do it. He\u2019s the one that fought currency devaluation. That\u2019s the single biggest tool that other countries have for taking our business, taking our money, and taking our jobs. And we can\u2019t let this go on any longer. Now, they\u2019re controlled by their PACs. They\u2019re controlled by the people that put up their campaign contributions. They\u2019re controlled, you know, with the lobbyists in Washington. They have signs on their forehead. It\u2019s like stamped into their forehead \u2013 \u201cI take care of Cruz.\u201d They\u2019re specialists. \u201cI take care of Kasich.\u201d \u201cI take care of Hillary.\u201d Oh, Hillary. Ayeyeye. \u201cTake care of Hillary.\u201d So we can\u2019t let it happen anymore. We can\u2019t let it happen anymore. It\u2019s time \u2013 you know Obama used to say, \u201cTime for change\u201d? I\u2019ll say it\u2019s time for change but real change this time not that change. Real change. Obama yesterday \u2013 President Obama yesterday for the first time he started having reservations about the Iran deal. I could have told him that six months ago, nine months ago, long before it was signed. The ink isn\u2019t even dry and now he\u2019s finally starting to understand it was a big beautiful mistake and it\u2019s only going to get worse. And by the way, Iran is getting worse. They were supposed to come into the community. Remember? What a bunch of babies. Are we babies? Are we babies? Hello over there. They were supposed to come into the community and they were supposed to, you know, get involved. Now, you see they just ordered 118 Airbus jets. Those are the big jets. 100. They didn\u2019t order Boeing. The reason \u2013 one of the reasons is we restrict them from spending. So we give them $150 billion and they\u2019re not even allowed to give us money by investing, by buying our products. Okay? How crazy are we? How much longer is it going to last? When are we going to get smart? When are we going to stop? We as a country are being ripped off. We are being ripped off by virtually every single country in the world. Okay? Whether it\u2019s militarily or trade. We don\u2019t win anymore. We can\u2019t win with the military. We can\u2019t beat ISIS. Can you imagine Gen. MacArthur or Gen. George Patton? They say get rid of ISIS. What do you think? \u2026It\u2019s so sad to see what\u2019s happening to our country and we\u2019re going to turn it around and we\u2019re going to change it. And we\u2019re going to make it rich again, and we\u2019re going to make it strong again. So, and so many different elements, and I\u2019ve been talking about trade. I always talk about trade. Because when I announced on June 16th coming down the escalator with Melania, it was like the Academy Awards. There were so many cameras; I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. So many cameras. And I took a deep breadth and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Because we have to do it. You know, it takes guts. Running for president, believe me, takes guts. It takes a lot of guts. Believe me. And even for the politicians they run at least they\u2019re out on the line, and then you see the dishonesty. You see where I won Louisiana and then I find out that I\u2019m not supposed to get as many delegates as the person that I beat. What kind of stuff is that? And somebody said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a rule and another rule.\u201d I don\u2019t care about rules, folks. I go out and I campaign. We win. We win. We get the delegates. Right? But in the meantime, we have millions more votes than Cruz. We\u2019ve beaten him in most of the states. I mean, we\u2019re just winning so much. And we\u2019re winning by almost 300 delegates. So we\u2019re doing great. And I think we close it out before the convention. I think we actually close it out before the convention.

This is the greatest man I have ever met and he is going to make America great again. Thank you all so much. God bless you.

Okay, thank you all very much. So, in coming over today and in going through a few of them, I said to a few of the folks I\u2019ve got to explain what\u2019s happening because our country is being decimated by stupidity, by bad deals, by horrible trades, by TPP, which Cruz wants badly and which is going to destroy Wisconsin. This Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disaster. Cruz is pushing it hard. Kasich, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a player here. I mean, the guy is one in 32. He\u2019s one and it was in his own state. And if I would have campaigned there two more days instead of staying in Florida, I would have won in my opinion Ohio. He\u2019s one and 32. Now, in all fairness, Jeb Bush was doing a lot better than that. Many people were doing better. It\u2019s called you get out. He\u2019s taking my votes. We have to get over 50%. And how do you do that? Look, at a certain point in life, what you do is you say, \u201cI\u2019m one in 32. In other words, I\u2019ve won one out of 32 states,\u201d and you do what Marco did, which was great, and you do what Rand Paul did, and you do what a lot of them did, and you get out.

You watch. But it sort of tells me when I first said this people would say, \u201cOh, it will cost a lot.\u201d Forgetting about the campaign. That\u2019s peanuts by comparison. You know, I\u2019ve spent tens of millions of dollars. But the big thing \u2013 I lost certain businesses and I owned the Miss Universe Pageant. I bought it very inexpensively many years ago \u2013 15 years ago \u2013 and because of the fact that they thought I was against this woman or that one, I had a hard time with television. Now, the good news is I sold it for a wonderful \u2013 I was very happy with that. But I didn\u2019t want to sell it. But I sold it and I built it to really a great company. We did a great job with that company \u2013 Miss Universe, Miss USA, Miss Teen USA. But other businesses \u2013 I sort of \u2013 like the shirts and the ties with Macy\u2019s. Macy\u2019s was unbelievably disloyal because of illegal immigration and they ended the shirts, ties. Who care? I mean, that\u2019s not a big deal. But I\u2019m doing something \u2013 nobody is giving up what I\u2019m giving. I mean, when Cruz runs, he runs. If he wins, great. If he loses, great. You know, it\u2019s him. He\u2019s a politician. They just \u2013 they run, they win, they lose, who knows? But these guys run for office. That\u2019s all they do. I\u2019ve always heard that if you\u2019re a very successful person, you can\u2019t run for office, especially for president. You just can\u2019t run for president, and I can see it. I have so much false press about me. Things that are so false. You know, I saw the other day on television, there were like 56,000 negative ads on me. 56,000. In fact, in Florida, I own Doral and in Florida we had the tournament there two weeks. Adam Scott \u2013 the great Adam Scott \u2013 the great golfer. He was winning. And in between shots, I told you this after the victory speech, in between they have commercials and they were all about Trump. Negative, horrible, negative commercials. Mostly false. Mostly. Not all false. But mostly false, I have to be honest. But it came out the other day, I think it said \u201c$68 million, 55,000 negative ads.\u201d Negative ads. And when I was running in Florida, I said \u201cHow is it possible to win?\u201d I mean, with all of this because I knew it. You couldn\u2019t turn on in Florida where I was you couldn\u2019t turn on the television without seeing Trump commercials. Sometimes four or five in a row. And they were horrendous. Done by very, very bad people. Very bad, evil people. And I said, \u201cHow it is possible to win?\u201d And God helped me. Honestly. Because I won in a landslide. I won by almost 20%. And now they\u2019re doing it here. Club for Growth. It\u2019s a crooked outfit. Look, Club for Growth \u2013 you ever hear this? Club for Growth \u2013 a friend of mine, he\u2019s a conservative guy. He goes would you do me a favor? See Club for Growth. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s Club for Growth?\u201d He said, \u201cThey want to talk to you.\u201d I said, \u201cAll right. Send them up.\u201d He\u2019s a friend. He\u2019s a good guy. And now I\u2019m in politics so I have to see people I wouldn\u2019t normally\u2026 So Club for Growth, they come up to my office. This guy was I think a former Congressman. And he tells me a little bit about Club for Growth and I\u2019m falling asleep. And then he goes, \u201c$1 million.\u201d And I said, \u201c$1 million for what? I don\u2019t even know you. I\u2019ve never met you.\u201d I said, \u201cDo me a favor.\u201d I\u2019m trying to be nice and I said, \u201cGo back and write me a little note if you can.\u201d And he was stupid enough to write me a note. He writes me a letter asking for $1 million. I let him know that I\u2019m not interested. You could be rich. I\u2019d rather take a million and throw it all over this room. I\u2019d rather give it to you, to your boy. \u2026They write me a letter. It\u2019s like extortion. They asked me for a $1 million. I said no nicely. And then they\u2019re doing ads all over Wisconsin. Club for Growth. They did it all over Florida. Club for Growth. About eminent domain. By the way, without eminent domain, you wouldn\u2019t have highways, you wouldn\u2019t have hospitals, you wouldn\u2019t have bridges. You need eminent domain. If something\u2019s in your way and you\u2019re building a highway, if you\u2019re producing 7,000 jobs and you need a little corner of someone\u2019s property, every once in a while. You know, it\u2019s funny. These guys all want the Keystone Pipeline. Right? Everyone. Conservatives. Conservatives want the Keystone Pipeline. I like the Keystone Pipeline too. But they have a whole big thing on eminent domain in their prospectus because without eminent domain, they wouldn\u2019t go 15 feet. They wouldn\u2019t be able to build it. So, they don\u2019t want eminent domain. They do commercials about eminent domain. They love the Keystone Pipeline, and the whole Keystone Pipeline is based around eminent domain because you\u2019ve got to go from Canada, where Cruz was born, to Texas, where he\u2019s representing. Think of it. This guy \u2013 and don\u2019t forget that. Remember what I said. I\u2019m going to win. Just remember what I said. I\u2019m going to win. And I thank you\u2026 I\u2019m going to win. But remember this. If for some reason he does, he gets the nomination, the first thing \u2013 remember, I\u2019m a good prognosticator, I\u2019m a good predictor \u2013 the first thing that\u2019s going to happen is the Democrats are going to sue Ted Cruz. He was born in Canada. He lived there for four years. The head of the Harvard Law School, one of the top people in the business in terms of Constitution, is saying that, you know, he\u2019s wrong. And we have a bunch of other people that are much stronger than even that. Remember this. If Cruz gets lucky and wins, and the only way he can get lucky is if he doesn\u2019t get \u2013 because it\u2019s all establishment. You know, if I go into that whole mess of the convention, I\u2019m not the establishment. I don\u2019t take their money. I don\u2019t hire their people. I don\u2019t do any of that stuff. Okay? So you have a disadvantage. But if Cruz wins, remember what I said. Just remember. Again, he\u2019s not going to win. But if he does, he gets the nomination, within the first few days he will be sued by the Democrats that he doesn\u2019t have the right to be president. And I think they\u2019re right because he wasn\u2019t born on our soil. He wasn\u2019t born. He\u2019s not a natural born citizen. He\u2019s not a natural born citizen. I don\u2019t like to make a big deal of this but it was just brought up by somebody. He is not a natural born citizen. So if for some reason he should get the nomination, I really believe you\u2019re wasting your time and boy do we have a problem because you\u2019re going to have somebody that\u2019s going to be sued, probably will lose the lawsuit. Again, he was born there, lived there for four years, mother was there, the whole thing for a long period of time, and he was a Canadian citizen joint with U.S. until 14 or 15 months ago. Did anyone know that? So he was a senator from Texas, only because of the great Sarah Palin by the way, without Sarah Palin, he could have never won that election. It was a fluke. But he was a Senator from Texas. He lived \u2013 he was a joint citizen. Now, he finally gave up his citizenship to Canada like 16 months ago. He said, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know I was a citizen of Canada also.\u201d Just like he didn\u2019t know that Goldman Sachs and Citibank gave him money. I mean, this guy is \u2013 you just have to study him, folks. Look, again, I\u2019m doing this. We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to turn this country around. We\u2019re going to make America great again. We\u2019re going to win a lot. But you have to know the facts. I love you all. I love you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

We have to get discipline \u2013 I mean, I have a case. I have a wonderful guy \u2013 campaign manager. You talk about discipline. And you probably saw what happened today with my campaign manager. He\u2019s a good guy. Corey [Lewandowski]. And by the way, the easiest thing \u2013 \u201cCorey, you\u2019re fired.\u201d I can\u2019t do that. Can\u2019t do it. So fortunately, I have a taping system. You know, very \u2013 I\u2019m rich so I have tapes all over. So this young woman who complained, was all \u2013 she was talking about being maybe thrown to the floor and all this. I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s horrible.\u201d And then we saw the tapes. Did anybody see the tape? What did you think? Right? Nothing. Women \u2013 what did you think? [Audience response inaudible]\u2026 I mean, she wasn\u2019t like \u2013 her face stayed the same. If somebody squeezed your arm or did something really bad \u2013 don\u2019t forget \u2013 initially she said thrown to the floor. But if somebody squeezed your arm or hurt you, wouldn\u2019t you start screaming or something? Did you see any change in her face? [Audience response inaudible]\n \u2026It\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s horrible. Honestly, it\u2019s horrible. And the best thing I could do is say \u2013 but I can\u2019t destroy a man. I\u2019d destroy him. Got a beautiful wife and children and I\u2019m not going to destroy a man for that. And you know what? When I saw that at the tape, at first I said, \u201cOh, this is terrible.\u201d Then I saw the tape. It\u2019s my tape. I\u2019m the one that had the tape. It\u2019s on the ceiling of this incredible club in Jupiter, Florida, and we\u2019re all leaving and we have a press conference. Right? And the press conference lasted a long time. It was like 45 minutes. So that was enough. I\u2019m leaving with a whole big gang of people. People pushing left and right, left and right. And all of a sudden, she bolts into the picture. She grabs me or hits me on the arm. In fact, I\u2019m like this with my arm up and then he goes by and maybe he touched her a little bit. But I didn\u2019t \u2013 it was almost like he was trying to keep her off me. Right? Like he was helping her. And did you see her fall to the ground? Okay, because she talked about falling to \u2013 now after, I must tell you, her statement changed big league because she said go to the ground. You know, all this. I could read it to you. Does anybody want to hear it? I mean, I want to be accurate because I\u2019d like the press to treat me. So before she knew she was on tape, she said \u201cI was jolted backwards.\u201d Was she jolted backwards? I mean, if she was, her face stayed the same. I mean. \u201cI was jolted backwards. Someone grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me me down. Campaign managers aren\u2019t supposed to forcefully throw reporters to the ground, except she never went to the ground. She never even came \u2013 flinched. She didn\u2019t \u2013 you know, if somebody grabbed you even one of the guys, even the bikers, if somebody grabs even a biker or punches you a little bit, you\u2019re \u201cWhoa!\u201d Right? I mean, the toughest guy, the toughest woman. Look at her face. It\u2019s zero. They\u2019re going to destroy a man\u2019s life? And then I have Cruz saying, \u201cOh, that was a terrible thing. That was a terrible thing.\u201d Let me tell you something, folks. If I win, if I lose, I didn\u2019t need to do this. I\u2019m doing this because I just had a beautiful grandchild with Ivanka. Ivanka and Jared \u2013 beautiful, beautiful grandchild. It\u2019s my eighth. I\u2019m doing this all for them. I didn\u2019t need to do this. This is not so easy. And I had no idea. You know, maybe none of us did. You know, I had no idea the message was going to get across. It\u2019s a message of competence. It really is. It\u2019s a message of common sense and it\u2019s a message of competence. And I had no idea that we\u2019d have millions of more votes than we had when we had that stiff Mitt Romney \u2013 a total stiff \u2013 who by the way he\u2019s a dope. He\u2019s not a smart person. I\u2019ll tell you right now. Let me tell you about Mitt Romney. That was an election he should have won and he lost. And he should just go away and let the big boys do it now because you know what? That\u2019s an election that should have been won. And I\u2019ll tell you what. I helped John McCain and at that time, honestly, that was a tough deal for him because the world was sort of collapsing. But he lost. And I helped Mitt Romney a lot and he lost. And I said, \u201cThis time, we\u2019re going to do it ourselves. We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win.\u201d So just remember that.

Remember that. I want to use not too many executive orders folks. You know, because executive orders came about more recently. Nobody ever heard of an executive order. Then all of a sudden Obama, because he couldn\u2019t get anybody to agree with him and he start signing them like they\u2019re butter. So I want to do away with executive orders for the most part. But look, just do me a favor. Stick with me. You\u2019re going to be okay. All right? \u2026I know, what you\u2019ve said I\u2019ve heard a hundred times and daycare is a huge problem. Huge problem.

And they\u2019re telling you how to educate their kids. Not going to happen that way. And I\u2019ve even seen it where they keep graduates \u2013 the child graduates and those parents stay on. They love it because their child went through the system. They love it and they become so good at it. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re one of the worst in the world in education.

But you know, I really want to win Wisconsin because if we could win Wisconsin, we\u2019re going to put all of this stupidity away. We\u2019re going to put these stupid, stupid people that allow and I\u2019m talking about basically politicians, and in many cases, you know a lot of times people will see deals that are done and I mean take a look at the Iran deal. How bad is that I mean, just as a deal\u2026 But many times people will say deals that the country makes, and they\u2019ll say, \u201cHow can our politicians be so stupid?\u201d They\u2019re not stupid.

But when you look at the people funding Cruz\u2019s campaign and Kasich\u2019s campaign, and you look \u2013 don\u2019t forget \u2013 Cruz said, \u201cOh the banks, the banks.\u201d You know, he\u2019s going to be Robin Hood. He\u2019s going to be this great guy. And then in her personal financial disclosure form, he forgot to mention that he borrowed about a million dollars from the banks \u2013 Citibank and Goldman Sachs. He borrowed a million dollars at an interest rate that everybody in this room would be proud to have \u2013 a very low interest rate. Almost no interest. He forgot to announce it on his personal financial disclosure form. He just forgot. He said, \u201cOh, I forgot. I forgot.\u201d Okay? So then he hits the banks.

They think it\u2019s almost like an impossible number \u2013 how can it be so bad? \u2013 and it actually could be even worse than that. We are going to take care of them. From their standpoint, they wait, they wait, then they get bad service, then they wait some more \u2013 six, seven, eight days.

And believe me, you know, Cruz likes to pretend he\u2019s an outsider and in the meantime he gets all the establishment support, including your governor. So believe me, believe me, they\u2019re all establishment. And frankly in a way it\u2019s worse because Cruz is establishment and yet he\u2019s got no relationship with the establishment. He goes and he stands on the floor of the Senate for a day and a half and he filibusters, and these Senators \u2013 look, I know. They\u2019re tough cookies. I have the best \u2013 I have one of the great people \u2013 Sen. Jeff Sessions, who\u2019s great. Nobody better than Jeff. And you know, Cruz thought he was going to have him and used him in his speech \u2013 \u201cSen. Jeff Sessions\u201d \u2013 and then he comes out and he endorses me. But when you think of it, look, out of all of these Senators, he has one supporter \u2013 Lee \u2013 who\u2019s his friend. I mean, he\u2019s his friend. And by the way took him plenty time to do it. But you know, to stand there and to rant and rave for two days to show people you can filibuster, in the meantime, nothing was accomplished. Cruz has not accomplished one thing. So he\u2019s an insider but it\u2019s almost like the man on the street because he can\u2019t get anything done. He dislikes people. He calls people like for instance he said horrible things about the Speaker and you know about the Speaker and he said about separately Mitch McConnell. I mean, he said some terrible things about \u2013 how do you get things done when you\u2019re calling Mitch McConnell bad names. Okay? Let\u2019s just say bad names. So he\u2019s sort of got the worst of all elements. He\u2019s an insider totally but he can get nothing done. Okay? He can get nothing done. Your new Speaker \u2013 how do you like Paul Ryan? How do you like him? Wow. I was told be nice to Paul Ryan because \u2013 really? Well, he\u2019s the Speaker. He\u2019s a nice guy. He called me the other day. He was very nice. But I\u2019m very surprised at this statement. Wow. Are you all Republicans? Are you mostly conservatives? \u2026I always say I\u2019m just a common sense conservative. And so, so important \u2013 common sense. And somebody told me today that somebody else \u2013 I think, Walker \u2013 used my term. You know, Walker used \u2013 I said, \u201cMake America great again.\u201d I said, \u201cMake America great again\u201d, and I copyrighted the term. And then Walker was making a speech many months ago when he first started and he was saying \u201cMake America great again\u201d because he saw the response that I got. The difference is he didn\u2019t get any response. So then no. But we told him he can\u2019t do that. That was the first real problem I had with him\u2026 Now, I said a common sense conservative and today I heard he used the term because the press was up and they interviewed me and they said he said he\u2019s a common sense conservative. Well, I coined the phrase a few months ago. That\u2019s what I am. I am a conservative. I\u2019m very, very conservative on the military. I\u2019m very conservative with our vets and on health care and on lots of things. But \u2013 and I\u2019m actually very conservative on trade but a lot of people would say \u201cHe\u2019s not that conservative on trade because he doesn\u2019t believe in free trade.\u201d Well, actually I do believe in free trade. But it\u2019s got to be good trade for us, right? It\u2019s got to be smart trade. It can\u2019t be where Wisconsin is losing thousands and thousands of jobs where you folks can\u2019t get into China but China comes in here like it\u2019s Swiss cheese. That\u2019s what happens.

And Christianity is under siege. I\u2019ll tell you, Christianity is under siege. You take a look. I\u2019m with the \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019ve been with so many pastors lately and Jerry Falwell Jr. was an example \u2013 was telling me that \u2013 first of all, he told me something that \u201cYou remind me so much of my father.\u201d I thought his father was a great guy. What his father did with Liberty College and Liberty University. And Jerry to top it off has taken it to a whole new place. But when Jerry was so strong and so great. But I was talking to \u2013 I probably had 50 of the ministers and pastors, different folks came up to my office, and they\u2019re really under tremendous pressure because they don\u2019t want to have their tax exempt status taken away. This happened during the Lyndon Johnson presidency. And I said, \u201cWhy is it that you folks are pushed around so much?\u201d Christianity. These are the pastors. These are strong people. These are really strong people. \u201cWhy do you allow that? Why aren\u2019t you more forceful?\u201d And finally, somebody said, \u201cWell, we have to be a little careful of our tax exempt status.\u201d I said when did that happen exactly? It was during the Johnson. Well, we\u2019re going to try to get rid of that. Okay? Because that\u2019s really terrible. We\u2019re going to try getting rid of \u2013 and I\u2019ve said that to a lot of evangelicals, a lot of great Christians. We\u2019re going to try to get rid of it because it sort of means somebody walking down the street has more power than somebody of religion, of our religion, of Christianity, somebody that\u2019s an evangelical. You take anybody they have more power because these people are powerless. They\u2019ve actually taken their right of free speech away. So I said we\u2019re going to try to get rid of that and I think we\u2019ll be very, very successful. You know, it\u2019s interesting. I said how many Christians are there? Because you know, we\u2019ve got men, we\u2019ve got women. You cut it in half, we\u2019ve actually have a few more women. But we are far more Christians than we have men or women. So in a way, it\u2019s the most powerful lobbyist \u2013 the biggest group of people. But they\u2019re not allowed to talk because they\u2019re petrified. You saw what was happening with the IRS and what was taking place with regard to certain groups. So we are going to try and usually when I say try that means I\u2019m going to get it done. That means I\u2019m going to get it done. But we are going to try very hard. We are going to get that brought back and I think it\u2019s going to be very hard to counter it. Because if the Christians, and if the whole evangelical Christian sector gets together, nobody, nobody can beat \u2013 You know, when I made the statement about banning Muslims on a temporary basis, I took such heat. Now people are saying, \u201cYou know, Trump is sort of right about that.\u201d Now they\u2019re all going, \u201cWow\u201d because they see what\u2019s happening. And I think if I would have said it about Christians, I think I would have had less opposition. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened in this country. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened in our country. And we can\u2019t let it happen. We\u2019re going to turn this country around and we\u2019re going to be the smart people. We\u2019re not going to be the dummies anymore.

Ayeyeye, we are in a big fat ugly bubble. We have interest rates that are so low that if you\u2019re rich like me I can borrow money for any amount. If you\u2019re a hardworking guy with a great farm or you\u2019re a hardworking developer or businessman you can\u2019t borrow money. You can only borrow money really cheaply \u2013 think of how bad it is \u2013 you can borrow money for nothing practically if you\u2019re rich. But if you\u2019re rich, you don\u2019t need the money so you don\u2019t have to borrow it. But if you\u2019re a businessperson and you want to go to the bank for a loan, you can\u2019t get it. The regulators are running the banks. Dodd-Frank is a disaster, by the way. It\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s a disaster. But the biggest disasters are regulations. Our rules and regulations are horrible. We\u2019re going to get rid of probably 85% of them. There are some we live with. But we\u2019ve got to go back. So many people in this area have told me regulations \u2013 regulatory climate \u2013 is the worst they\u2019ve ever seen. I have a friend, who\u2019s a farmer, and if a puddle forms, they consider it a lake for the purposes of environmental. It\u2019s like a puddle and they\u2019d consider it a lake. So we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. So here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re going to make our country so great again. We\u2019re going to make our country so strong again. Our military is going to be so amazing. We\u2019re never going to have to use it. Don\u2019t forget, I didn\u2019t want to go into Iraq. All these guys think that I\u2019m a tough guy so I\u2019m going to be so quick with the trigger. I\u2019m not going to be quick. I was the slowest with the trigger. I didn\u2019t want the trigger. Now, when Obama left though, he shouldn\u2019t have left the way he did. He gave a certain date, and the enemy said, \u201cIt can\u2019t be possible. Nobody would be that stupid. Nobody.\u201d So I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019d hurt that much because I don\u2019t think the enemy would ever believe that anybody would be stupid enough to give a date \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re leaving on this date.\u201d And then he left. They said, \u201cHe was serious!\u201d They pulled back. They pulled back. Then you see what happened. They pulled back then they went in with fury. But how about the 50 soldiers. He sent a couple of months ago, a few months ago, he sent 50 of our finest and instead of just sending them quietly, quietly sending them. What does he do? He sends them in and he makes a big press conference or announcement that \u201cWe are sending 50 soldiers in Iraq, Syria\u201d and these soldiers have a big target on their backs. Why can\u2019t we just keep our mouths shut? Why can\u2019t we be unpredictable? Unpredictable? Right? Why can\u2019t we be unpredictable? Why does he have to tell \u2013 first of all, it doesn\u2019t even sound good when you say \u201c50 soldiers\u201d because it sounds like so small. People would say, \u201cIs that good or bad?\u201d I mean, that sounds small. But then when you think about it, why do we have to say that? These are extraordinary people. These are our finest. And they\u2019re, you know, very dangerous missions. Why would you tell people that we\u2019re sending them in? You just keep quiet and let them accomplish something.

But you were there. Remember, he was going to win that in a landslide. And then I started speaking. I started talking to people, and I started saying the good and the bad and the ugly. And we won in a landslide and we won the evangelicals. I\u2019ve won just about I think almost every place I\u2019ve won with evangelicals. And it\u2019s been an amazing time. So now I\u2019m here to talk to the people of Wisconsin. I have friends in Wisconsin. I\u2019ve been here before. It\u2019s an incredible place but it\u2019s a place that has problems. But you have a governor that has you convinced that it doesn\u2019t have a problem. I remember when he was on the campaign trail, I was so nice to him. I said, \u201cHow can I hit him? I\u2019m not going to hit him. I\u2019m not going to hit him.\u201d And I was so nice. I hit Jeb instead, right? Right? And I hit Rand, Rand, old Rand. And I hit a lot of people and they all went down. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a president that could just with his mouth make things happen that are positive? You know. But it\u2019s not with the mouth. It\u2019s really with the mouth, the heart, and the brain. Remember the brain. I have a lot of friends. They\u2019re good with the mouth but they\u2019re not good with the brain. It all doesn\u2019t work. Okay? You know, we had an interesting thing today. A poll came out \u2013 a nationwide poll. A great poll. It was Trump 48%. It was an NBC poll. Trump 48%. Cruz was second in the 20s, mid-20s something. And Kasich was way down. So what happened is they showed the poll. It was an NBC poll. They call it an NBC monkey poll. And it was on the Today Show, and it was on Morning Joe. Morning Joe held it up and he said, \u201cWow, those are great numbers.\u201d 48% is pretty good. You have three people. You know. I don\u2019t get enough credit for that. I\u2019ve been at 42%, 44%, 45%, and I\u2019ve had like seven people. How do you get 45% when you have seven people? Nobody says that. They say, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t cracked 50%.\u201d How do you crack 50% when you have all these people running? So I\u2019m at 48%. Poll was good \u2013 way, way ahead of anybody else nationwide. And they showed Hillary Clinton \u2013 hers is very close. She\u2019s got a little problem. Could happen. Got a bigger problem with the emails than she has with Bernie to be honest with you. She should have. Her bigger problem should be with emails. We\u2019ll find out how honest our country is, right? But she\u2019s got a sort of close race. And they put her poll up and it was put up there. You know, big letters. And then they said, \u201cAnd Donald Trump is winning.\u201d That was it. They didn\u2019t put numbers up. They didn\u2019t say I\u2019m doing great. In fact, they said, \u201cDonald Trump is winning,\u201d and they put some \u2013 a little slightly negative statistic in \u2013 it was like wait a minute. They put her numbers up and they didn\u2019t put my numbers up. Folks, it\u2019s so unfair. The press is so dishonest. It\u2019s unbelievable. That was Chuck Todd. That was Chuck Todd this morning on the Today Show. They put Hillary\u2019s numbers. And I\u2019m winning by a lot and they said, \u201cDonald Trump is winning. You know, let\u2019s go to a new subject, okay?\u201d Now, I guarantee you one thing. If I was losing or doing poorly, it\u2019ll still be up. It\u2019ll be up all morning because they don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m putting up my own money. They don\u2019t like it. Ted Cruz and Kasich are getting money from the banking industries, the energy industries. They\u2019re getting money from the pharmaceutical companies. They\u2019re getting money from everybody. Folks, you can\u2019t straighten out this mess \u2013 we\u2019re in a mess \u2013 if you can\u2019t do what you have to do. When millions of dollars are given to Cruz and Kasich and millions from different industries, you\u2019re not going to be able to say, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to do and go against the banking industry to do what\u2019s right for the people\u201d if the banking industry gave you millions of dollars. Now, that\u2019s true with Hillary also. Now, she\u2019s gotten millions of dollars. But I\u2019m the only one self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m in for a lot of money. I in a lot of money. What is beautiful is when I was running against Jeb in New Hampshire. I was in for like $2 million. Jeb was in for like $48 million. I was in first and he was close to last. I said, \u201cWho do you want as your president?\u201d By the way, did Jeb endorse anybody yet? Because I haven\u2019t heard. Because I think Jeb probably endorsed \u2013 huh? Did he endorse? It just shows you how important it is. Nobody even knows. I don\u2019t even know. He\u2019ll probably \u2013 he\u2019ll endorse \u2013 just so you know. Look, when you\u2019re in war, you\u2019ve got to fight and you fight hard. When I fight, I win. You\u2019re going to win. You know that. You\u2019re going to win.

He came up to my office like about a year ago before I did \u2013 you know, I\u2019ve been a politician for about eight months, right? I never thought I\u2019d be a politician. The last thing on my mind I want to be was a politician. But I built a great company. I filed papers. The company is incredible. Very little debt, tremendous cash flow, some of the great assets in the world. And I say that not in a bragging way. I say that because that\u2019s the kind of thinking we need, folks. We can\u2019t have China ripping us off and Mexico and Japan and Vietnam. We can\u2019t have it. We can\u2019t have it. And they are ripping us like they\u2019ve never ripped anybody before. We\u2019ve rebuilt China. I mean, we\u2019re rebuilding Mexico. You look the other day you saw Carrier moving down. Carrier Air Conditioning. I buy those air conditioners \u2013 a lot of them. I\u2019m not buying any more of them. But Carrier Air Conditioning moving to Mexico. Ford moving to Mexico. Nabsico \u2013 home of the formerly wonderful Oreo which we don\u2019t eat anymore. Right? We don\u2019t eat it. We don\u2019t eat it. Number one, it\u2019s a good \u2013 it\u2019s called an enforced diet. But you know what? Look, we\u2019re losing our jobs. Look at your jobs. When I see that statistic, I mean you\u2019re losing your jobs. When I went after your governor when he decided to run and I said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to be nice to him. He\u2019s a nice guy.\u201d The guy came up to my office. He handed me a plaque because I supported him. What do I know? I supported him. I gave $50,000 or $100,000. That\u2019s a lot of money for a guy you\u2019ve never met before. Right? That\u2019s pretty good. But I like the fact that he was fighting, fighting, he was always fighting. You know, to a certain extent, I\u2019d rather see somebody able to make a deal without having to go through all of that mess. But he was fighting and I gave him a lot of money and he came up, you know, a year ago or so and he gave me a plaque. Beautiful picture of something. I haven\u2019t \u2013 I never really got to read it to be honest. And I put it aside. That was it\u2026 Because if we win Wisconsin, it\u2019s going to be like over, pretty much over. Because we\u2019re going to do great. \u2026Emerson poll came out. I think I have 67%, 68% in New York compared to like 10% or whatever, and you have Cruz talk about New York values, New Yorkers are no good. I watched New Yorkers rebuild the World Trade Center. I watched New Yorkers dying. Believe me, New Yorkers are good. New Yorkers are very good. But Cruz said they\u2019re no good. So anyways, so I think we\u2019re going to do great in New York. We\u2019re going to do great in New Jersey. Chris Christie endorsed me. We\u2019ll do great in New Jersey. Good guy. Ben Carson endorsed me. Sarah Palin endorsed me. Sheriff Joe from Arizona. We love Sheriff Joe. And you know, with the evangelicals, I\u2019ve had so many ministers. I\u2019ve had so many pastors endorse me. And Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed me. It was incredible and we\u2019ve done so well with the evangelicals. I mean, Christians, evangelicals, we\u2019ve done so well.

And this is something that\u2019s so special and so amazing and it\u2019s on the cover of time magazine. It\u2019s on the cover of every newspaper. It\u2019s something that has maybe never happened and they\u2019re saying it\u2019s phenomenon. Sometimes they say I\u2019m a phenomenon. I\u2019m not. The message is what we want. We want jobs. We want trade deals that are smart deals not stupid deals. And you know, Wisconsin. I wrote down some notes\u2026and it\u2019s like devastating. So [Scott] Walker came out today. I wrote down notes about Wisconsin. Look, he certainly can\u2019t endorse me after what I did to him in the race. Right? But look at this. By the summer of 2015, Wisconsin was facing a $2.2 billion two-year budget deficit. That\u2019s terrible. By the way, these are out of books. Like this isn\u2019t Trump. This is out of books. Total state debt is $45 billion. Now, maybe somebody is going to tell me that\u2019s wrong but again these are \u2013 $45 billion. Very high. One of the higher ones. 20,000 fewer people in the labor force in Wisconsin than seven years ago even though population has grown by 100,000. So your population is higher. Now, I wouldn\u2019t have done this but he endorsed Cruz. What am I going to do? Am I going to say he\u2019s doing a great job? He\u2019s not doing a great job. You know, he comes in with his big motorcycle jacket and big Harley. I love Harleys. Right? But the motorcycle guys like Trump. They really like Trump. And he doesn\u2019t look like a motorcycle guy to me. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. Unemployment rate \u2013 well, they say \u2013 that can\u2019t be possible. Unemployment \u2013 they have down 20%. That can\u2019t be possible. What? Is it 20%? Effective or regular? Effective unemployment rate 20%. Hey, this is out of the big book. 800,000 food stamp recipients. Middle class hit very, very hard due to loss of manufacturing jobs. These are the stats. Right? You know about this, right? It goes on and on. Wisconsin has lost 15,000 net jobs to Mexico since NAFTA. Now, just so you understand, Kasich is running also. We forget about him. He voted for NAFTA. Both of them want TPP.

That pattern practiced by the president and his administration including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is a total disaster by the way. She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly. But it has repeated itself over and over again and has done nothing to embolden those who hate America. We saw that with releasing the $150 billion to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. It didn\u2019t happen. President Obama thinks that apply pressure to Israel will force the issue but it\u2019s precisely the opposite that happens. Already, half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS and Hamas, and the other half refuses to confront the first half.

We will get it solved. But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially. That\u2019s what will happen when Donald Trump is president of the United States. We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the state of Israel. The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that. And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish state. I love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel.

You had Camp David in 2000 where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer \u2013 maybe even too generous. Arafat rejected it. In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer. The Palestinian Authority rejected it also. Then John Kerry tried to come up with a framework and Abbas didn\u2019t even respond. Not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America.

The problem is no one has done anything about it. We will. We will. I promise we will. Thank you. Which brings me to my next point \u2013 the utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. The United Nations is not a friend of democracy. It\u2019s not a friend of freedom. It\u2019s not a friend even to the United States of America, where as you know it has its home. And it surely is not a friend to Israel. With President Obama in his final year \u2013 yay! \u2013 he may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel. Believe me. Believe me. And you know it. And you know it better than anybody. So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a Security Council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine.

Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years. But when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial size military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran\u2019s behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in and especially Israel. When I\u2019m president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran\u2019s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be. But if I\u2019m not elected president, I know how to deal with trouble and, believe me, that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to be elected president, folks. And we are leading in every poll. Remember that please. Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen, and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. Literally everyday, Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states. Hezbollah, Lebanon received and I\u2019ll tell you what \u2013 it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons, and GPS systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have. Now they\u2019re in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas and Islamic jihad. And in the West Bank, they\u2019re openly offering Palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every Palestinian terrorist\u2019s home that\u2019s been destroyed. A deplorable, deplorable situation . Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East and it\u2019s absolutely incredible that we handed them over $150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror. Secondly, we will totally dismantle Iran\u2019s global terror network, which is big and powerful but not powerful like us. Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world. During the last five years, Iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They\u2019ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach.

I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. I\u2019m a newcomer to politics but not to backing the Jewish state. In 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City and on Washington and frankly the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated and they were prepetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims. I sent my plane because I backed the mission for Israel 100%. In spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the grand marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel Parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state. It was a very dangerous time for Israel and frankly for anyone supporting Israel. Many people turned down this honor. I did not. I took the risk, and I\u2019m glad I did. But I didn\u2019t come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That\u2019s what politicians do. All talk, no action \u2013 believe me.

Thank you. My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. Thank you. Thank you. I have been in business a long time. I know dealmaking. And let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic for America, for Israel, and for the whole of the Middle East. The problem here is fundamental. We\u2019ve rewarded the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion and we received absolutely nothing in return. I\u2019ve studied this issue in great detail. I would say actually greater by far than anybody else. Believe me. Oh, believe me. And it\u2019s a bad deal. The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it because already, you know, as you know it has. The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. And of course, they\u2019ll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them.

Actually now according to the Economist, I\u2019m at 53%. And I have to explain to these people they don\u2019t understand basic physics, basic mathematics, basic whatever you want to call it. When I don\u2019t get over 50%, we have four people. Right? We have four people. Do you understand that? So when I get 53% \u2013 and this one is an example, I had 53% and that\u2019s with four people. That\u2019s an achievement just mathematically when you can get over 50%.

Thank you. Haha. Let me say that again. There\u2019s plenty of evidence that Mr. Trump is a con man, a fake. Mr. Trump has changed his positions not just over the years but over the course of the campaign and on that Ku Klux Klan daily for three days in a row. We will only really know if he\u2019s a real deal or a phony if he releases his tax returns a tape of his interview with the New York Times. I predict that there are more bombshells in his tax returns. I predict that he doesn\u2019t give much of anything to the disabled and to our veterans. I predict that he told the New York Times that his immigration talk is just that \u2013 talk. And I predict that despite his promise to do so first made over a year ago, that he will never, ever release his tax returns. Never. Not the returns under audit. Not even the returns that are no longer being audited. He has too much to hide. Nor will he authorize the release of the tapes that he made with the New York Times. If I\u2019m right, you\u2019ll have all the proof you\u2019ll need to know that Donald Trump is indeed a phony. Attacking me as he surely will won\u2019t prove of any less of a phony. It\u2019s entirely in his hands to prove me wrong. All he has to do is release his back taxes like he promised he would and let us hear what he said behind closed doors to the New York Times. You know, Ronald Reagan used to quote a Scottish philosopher, who predicted that democracies and civilizations wouldn\u2019t last month longer than a couple of hundred years. And John Adams wrote this: \u201cRemember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.\u201d That\u2019s John Adams. I believe that America has proven these dire predictions wrong for two reasons. First, we\u2019ve been blessed with great presidents, with giants among us. Men of character, integrity, and selflessness have led our nation from the very beginning. None were perfect. Each surely made mistakes. But in every case, they acted out of desire to do what was right for America and for the cause of freedom. The second reason is because we\u2019re blessed with a great people \u2013 people who at every critical moment of choosing have put the interests of the country above their own. These two things are related. Our presidents time and again have called on us to rise to the occasion. John F. Kennedy asked us to consider what we could do for our country. Lincoln drew upon the better angels of our nature to save the union. I understand the anger Americans feel today. In the past, our presidents have channeled that anger and forged it into resolve, into endurance and high purpose, and into the will to defeat the enemies of freedom. Our anger was transformed into energy directed for good. Mr. Trump is directing our anger for less than noble purposes. He creates scapegoats of Muslims and Mexican immigrants. He calls for the use of torture. He calls for killing the innocent children and family members of terrorists. He cheers assaults on protesters. He applauds the prospect of twisting the constitution to limit the First Amendment freedom of the press. This is very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss. Here\u2019s what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He\u2019s playing the members of the American public for suckers. He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat. His domestic policies would lead to recession. His foreign policies would make America and the world less safe. He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president and his personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill. I\u2019m convinced America has greatness ahead and this is a time for choosing. God bless us to choose a nominee who will make that vision a reality. Thank you and God bless you all. Thank you.

There is a dark irony in his boasts of his sexual exploits during the Vietnam War while at the same time John McCain who he has mocked was imprisoned and tortured. Dishonesty is Donald Trump\u2019s hallmark. He claimed that he had spoken clearly and boldly against going into Iraq. Wrong. He spoke in favor of invading Iraq. He said he saw thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating 9/11. Wrong. He saw no such thing. He imagined it. He\u2019s not of the temperament of the kind of stable, thoughtful person we need as leader. His imagination must not be married to real power. The president of the United States has long been the leader of the free world. The president and, yes, even the nominees of the country\u2019s great parties help define America to billions of people around the world. All of them bear the responsibility of being an example for our children and our grandchildren.

Watch, by the way, how he responds to my speech today. Will he talk about policy difference? Or will he attack me with every imaginable low road insult? This may tell you what you need to know about his temperament, his stability, and his suitability to be president. Now, Mr. Trump relishes any poll that reflects what he thinks of himself. But polls are also saying that he will lose to Hillary Clinton. Think about that. On Hillary Clinton\u2019s watch, the State Department, when she was guiding it and part of the Obama administration, that State Department watched as America\u2019s interest was diminished at every corner of the world. She compromised our national secrets. She dissembled to the families of the slain. And she jettisoned her most profound beliefs to gain presidential power. For the last three decades, the Clintons have lived at the intersection of money and politics, trading their political influence to enrich their personal finances. They embodied the term crony capitalism. They disgust the American people and causes them to lose faith in our political process. A person so untrustworthy and dishonest as Hillary Clinton must not become president. Of course, a Trump nomination enables her victory, and the audio and video of the infamous Tapper-Trump exchange on the Ku Klux Klan will play 100,000 times on cable and who knows how many million times on social media.\n\u2026 ", "name": "Transcript: Mitt Romney\u2019s speech on Donald Trump \u2013 Part 3"}, {"text": "So even though Donald Trump has offered very few specific economic plans, what little he has said is enough to know that he would be very bad for American workers and for American families. But you\u2019d say, \u201cWait, wait, wait. Isn\u2019t he a huge business success? Doesn\u2019t he know what he\u2019s talking about?\u201d No, he isn\u2019t, and no, he doesn\u2019t. Look, his bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who work for them. He inherited his business; he didn\u2019t create it. And whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there\u2019s Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not. Now, not every policy that Donald Trump has floated is bad. Of course, he wants to repeal and replace Obamacare. He wants to bring jobs home from China and Japan. But his prescriptions to do those things are flimsy at best. At the last debate, all he could remember about his health care plan was to remove boundaries between states. Successfully bringing jobs home requires serious policies and reforms that make America the place businesses want to come, want to plan, and want to grow. You can\u2019t punish business into doing what you want. Frankly, the only serious policy proposals that deal with the broad range of national challenges we confront today come from Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich. One of these men should be our nominee.  Now, I know that some people want this race to be over. They look at history and say a train like Mr. Trump isn\u2019t going to be stopped. Perhaps. But the rules of political history have pretty much all been shredded during this campaign. If the other candidates can find some common ground, I believe we can nominate a person who can win the general election and who will represent the values and policies of conservatism. Given the current delegate selection process, that means that I vote for Marco Rubio in Florida, for John Kasich in Ohio, and for Ted Cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump in a given state. Now, let me turn to national security and the safety of our homes and loved ones. Mr. Trump\u2019s bombast is already alarming our allies and fueling the enmity of our enemies. Insulting all Muslims will keep many of them from fully engaging with us in the urgent fight against ISIS. And for what purpose? Muslim terrorists would only have to lie about their religion to enter the country. And then what he said on 60 Minutes. Did you hear this? It was Syria and ISIS and it has to go down as the most ridiculous and dangerous idea of the entire campaign season. \u201cLet ISIS take out Assad,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we can pick up the remnants.\u201d Now, think about that. Let the most dangerous terror organization the world has ever known take over an entire country? This recklessness is recklessness in the extreme. Now, Donald Trump tells us that he is very, very smart. I\u2019m afraid that when it comes to foreign policy he is very, very not smart. Now, I\u2019m far from the first to conclude that Donald Trump lacks the temperament to be president. After all, this is an individual who mocked a disabled reported, who attributed a reporter\u2019s question to her menstrual cycle, who mocked a brilliant rival who happened to be a woman due to her appearance, who bragged about his marital affairs, and who laces his public speeches with vulgarity.

Instead, I\u2019d like to offer my perspective on the nominating process of my party. Back in 1964, just days before the presidential election, which incidentally we lost, Ronald Reagan went on national television and challenged America, saying that it was a time for choosing. He saw two paths for America, one that embraced conservative principles dedicated to lifting people out of poverty and helping creating opportunity for all and the other an oppressive government that would lead America down a darker less free path. I\u2019m no Ronald Reagan and this is a different moment in time. But I believe with all my heart and soul that we face another time for choosing \u2013 one that will have profound consequences for the Republican Party and more importantly for our country. I say this in part because of my conviction that America is poised to lead the world for another century. Our technology engines, our innovation dynamic, the ambition and skill of our people are going to propel our economy and raise the standard of living of Americans. America will remain as it is today the envy of the world. You may have seen Warren Buffett. He said and I think he\u2019s 100% right that the babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have real problems and serious challenges. We do. At home, poverty persists and wages are stagnant. The horrific massacres of Paris and San Bernardino, the nuclear ambitions of the Iranian mullahs, the aggressions of Putin, the growing assertiveness of China, and the nuclear tests of North Korea confirm that we live in troubled and dangerous times. But if we make the right choices, America\u2019s future will be even better than our past and better than our present. On the other hand, if we make improvident choices, the bright horizons I\u2019ve described will not materialize. And let me put it very plainly, if we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished. Let me explain why I say that. First, on the economy, if Donald Trump\u2019s plans were ever implemented, the country would sink into prolonged recession. A few examples: His proposed 35% tariff-like penalties would instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for consumers, kill our export jobs, and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all stripes to flee America. His tax plan in combination with his refusal to reform entitlements and to honestly address spending would balloon the deficit and the national debt.\n\u2026 ", "name": "Transcript: Mitt Romney\u2019s speech on Donald Trump \u2013 Part 1"}, {"text": "Question: \n[Inaudible]\n I go throughout the world. I mean, you go to Qatar\u2026you go to any \u2013 so many places, you go to different places in China, different places in Asia, different places in the Middle East, you look at some of the airports they have, you look at the roadways they have, you look at the transportation systems they have and the trains they have, we\u2019re like a third world country. So I\u2019m going to be very good for the world. I\u2019m going to get along with the world. You\u2019re going to be very proud of me. Even you will be very proud of me as a president. But we have to rebuild our country. Our country is going to hell and people don\u2019t understand that. And Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t have a clue. She can\u2019t do that. She\u2019s talking about \u2013 I mean, one of the things that really bothered me \u2013 I think one of the reasons I have such great support \u2013 is that people \u2013 you take a look \u2013 people in the middle income groups are making less money today \u2013 less money \u2013 than they made 12 years ago. And in her speech she said they\u2019re making less money. Well, she\u2019s been there with Obama for a long period of time. Why hasn\u2019t she done anything about it? Practically everything she was complaining about, she\u2019s picked up what I say. The difference is she\u2019s been there for a long period of time. Why haven\u2019t they done anything about it? Then you look at her record as Secretary of State. It\u2019s abysmal. You look at what\u2019s going on with Syria. You look at what\u2019s going on with everything. It\u2019s a disaster. So we\u2019re going to have an interesting period of time. I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s going to be allowed to run. What she did is a criminal act. If she\u2019s allowed to run, I would be very, very surprised. But if she\u2019s allowed to run, honestly, it\u2019ll be a sad day for this country because what she did was wrong. What she did \u2013 let me just tell you \u2013 what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they\u2019ve paid a very, very big price. Question: \n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question: \n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n What I really have is a great number of people. I have millions and millions of people. And when I was watching those broadcasts just a little while ago before I came in here because I wanted to see exactly where we were before I started speaking, I was amazed at the kind of numbers. The Republicans have tremendous energy. The Democrats don\u2019t. They don\u2019t have any energy. Their numbers are down. Our numbers are through the roof. And people are making statements that they\u2019ve never seen in modern times a party that was so energized. I think if somebody is doing as well as I\u2019m doing and I\u2019m not just speaking for myself, whether me or anybody else, but if I\u2019m going to win five \u2013 I\u2019ve already won five \u2013 but maybe it could be six, seven, eight, nine. It could be nine. I could win nine states tonight. If I\u2019m going to win all of these states with tremendous numbers and if I\u2019m going to come in the worst second in the two or three that I might not win, I think, you know, we\u2019re a democracy. I think it\u2019s awfully hard to say that\u2019s not the person we want to lead the party. Right? You know, it\u2019s very hard. \u2026I really think that one of the biggest things that everybody is seeing happening \u2013 and everybody \u2013 is the Republican Party has become more dynamic. It\u2019s become more diverse. We\u2019re taking from the Democrats. We\u2019re taking from the independents. We have a lot more people. We have a lot more people. I mean, take a look at South Carolina. Look at the numbers. Look at the numbers from four years ago when nobody even wanted to waste their time and vote. And then you look at the \u2013 I was there. And you had lines that went a mile long, and it was virtually more than doubled. So we have a very, very dynamic party. And I think we\u2019re going to be able to unify the party. I hope to be able to get along with everybody. I don\u2019t know Paul Ryan well but I hope to be able to get along with him. I do know Mitch McConnell a little bit but I hope to be able to get along with him. But remember this, I have millions and millions and millions of people. This isn\u2019t like it\u2019s a close match. I mean, it\u2019s only too bad that winner didn\u2019t take all because if winner took all, this is over; we\u2019re just having a celebration. You know, we\u2019re having a celebration. So anyway, I would like to \u2013 look, I just want to end by thanking everybody. This has been an amazing period in my life. My wife just called, and Ivanka, as you know, is going to be having a baby very soon and she\u2019s a special person. It\u2019s going to be great and we look forward to that. She\u2019s back in New York. She wanted to be here. They all want to be here but they\u2019re with Ivanka now and that could be certainly within the next week. But this has been an amazing period of time. It\u2019s been amazing for me even from an educational standpoint. And I think honestly we\u2019ve done something that almost nobody thought could be done and I\u2019m very proud of it. And I just want to leave you with this: I am a unifier. I would love to see the Republican Party and everybody get together and unify. And when we unify, there\u2019s nobody \u2013 nobody \u2013 that\u2019s going to beat us. Thank you very much everybody.

They came from the Democratic Party or the Democrat Party and they\u2019re Democrats and they\u2019re longtime Democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched. And they were independents. And we\u2019ve actually expanded the party. Look at the number of votes we\u2019ve had in that area as an example. Four years ago, they had 390,000 or so votes; we doubled it. We\u2019re almost 800,000. Whereas the Democrats went down. There\u2019s much less enthusiasm for the Democrats. I, look, I am a unifier.

Our party is expanding. And all you have to do is take a look at the primary states where I\u2019ve won, and just look where we\u2019ve gone from an X number to a much larger number. That hasn\u2019t happened to the Republican Party in many, many decades. So I think we\u2019re going to be more inclusive. I think we\u2019re going to be more unified.

And the trade deficit\u2019s at $400 billion and $500 billion are too much. No country can sustain that kind of trade deficit. It won\u2019t be that way for long.

Or they\u2019d move from New Jersey to someplace else, Chris. But now they\u2019re moving from here \u2013 but not that many people are leaving New Jersey. But Chris understands the problem.

And if General Petraeus were here, he would tell you that the most effective method of gaining information is establishing a friendly relationship with the detainee. Obviously we need intelligence to defeat our enemies. But we need reliable intelligence. Torture produces more misleading information than actionable intelligence. And what the advocates of harsh and cruel interrogation methods have never established is that we couldn\u2019t have gathered as good or more reliable intelligence from using humane methods. The most important lead we got in the search for Bin Laden came from using conventional interrogation methods. I think it\u2019s an insult to the many intelligence officers who\u2019ve acquired good intelligence without hurting or degrading prisoners to assert we can\u2019t win this war on terrorism without such methods. Yes, we can and we will. But in the end, torture\u2019s failure to serve its intended purpose isn\u2019t the main reason to oppose its use. I\u2019ve often said and will always maintain that this question isn\u2019t about our enemies. It\u2019s about us. It\u2019s about who we were, who we are, and who we aspire to be. It\u2019s about how we represent ourselves to the world. We\u2019ve made our way in this often dangerous and cruel world not by just strictly pursuing our geopolitical interests but by exemplifying our political values and influencing other nations to embrace them. When we fight to defend our security we fight also for an idea that all men are endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights. That\u2019s all men and women. How much safer the world would be if all nations believe the same? How much dangerous it can become when we forget it ourselves even momentarily as we learned from Abu Ghraib? Our enemies act without conscience; we must not. It isn\u2019t necessary and it isn\u2019t even helpful in winning this strange and long war we\u2019re fighting. Our nation needs a commander-in-chief that understands and affirms this basic truth. Our nation needs a commander-in-chief who will make clear to those that fight on our behalf that they are defending this sacred ideal and that sacrificing our national honor and our respect for human dignity will make it harder, not easier, to prevail in this war. And our nation needs a commander-in-chief that reminds us that in the worst of times through the chaos and terror of war, when facing cruelty, suffering and loss, that we are always Americans \u2013 different, stronger, and better than those who would destroy us\u2026 ", "name": "Transcript: Sen. John McCain\u2019s floor speech on Trump\u2019s remarks on torture \u2013 Part 3"}, {"text": "I understand that in the aftermath of the worst terrorist attack on our homeland, those who approved harsh interrogation methods and those who used them were sincerely dedicated to securing justice for the victims of terrorist attacks and to protecting Americans from further harm. And I know that in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, many Americans feel again the grave urgency that we felt 15 years ago. But dispute wholeheartedly that it was right for our nation to use these interrogation methods then or that it is right for our nation to use them now. Waterboarding or any other form of torture is not in the best interests of justice, not our security, nor the ideals we have sacrificed so much blood and treasure to defend. It is the knowledge of torture\u2019s dubious efficacy and the strong moral objections of the abuse of prisoners that has forged broad bipartisan agreement on this issue. Last year, the United States Senate passed in an overwhelming vote of 91 to 3 the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2016 \u2013 legislation that took a historic step forward to ban torture once and for all by limiting U.S. government interrogation techniques to those in the Army Field Manual. That vote was 91 to 3. There was debate and discussion about it in the Armed Services Committee and on the floor of this Senate. The vote was 91 to 3. Now, candidates are saying they will disregard the law. I thought that was our complaint \u2013 the Republicans\u2019 complaint with the present president of the United States. The U.S. military has successfully interrogated more foreign terrorist detainees than any other agency of our government. The Army Field Manual in its current form has worked for the United States military including on high value terrorist detainees in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, and it reflects current best-thinking and practices on interrogation. Moreover, the Army Field Manual embodies the values Americans have embraced for generations, preserving the ability of our interrogators to extract critical intelligence from our adversaries while recognizing that torture and cruel treatment are ineffective interrogation methods. Some of the nation\u2019s most respected leaders from the U.S. military, CIA, and the FBI supported this legislation as well as numerous human rights organizations and faith groups, including the National Association of Evangelicals and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

Regardless of who wins, this is a celebration of our vibrant democracy of engaged citizens putting candidates to the test and demanding answers on the tough issues that the next president will confront. It\u2019s another important step in choosing our next commander-in-chief, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. As we heard from the Director of National Intelligence this morning, the threats to our nation are growing more diverse, more complex and more dangerous. More than ever, we need a commander-in-chief with a clear vision, a steady hand, sound judgment, and confidence not only in our nation\u2019s power but in the values and ideals that generations of American heroes have fought for and died defending. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been so disappointing to see some presidential candidates engaged in loose talk on the campaign trail about reviving waterboarding and other inhumane interrogation techniques. It might be easy to dismiss this bluster as cheap campaign rhetoric, but these statements must not go unanswered because they mislead the American people about the realities of interrogation, how to gather intelligence, what it takes to defend our security, and at the most fundamental level what we are fighting for as a nation and what kind of nation we are. It\u2019s important to remember the facts that these forms of torture not only failed their purpose to secure actionable intelligence to prevent further attacks on the United States and our allies but compromised our values, stained our national honor, and did little practical good. While some have shamefully sought to minimize the practice of waterboarding, it is clear to me that this practice, which was a simulated execution by drowning, amounts to torture as any reasonable person would define it and how the Geneva Conventions of which we are signatories on the treatment of prisoners of war defines it. The use of these methods by the United States was shameful and unnecessary because the United States has tried, convicted, and executed foreign combatants who employed methods of torture, including waterboarding, against American prisoners of war. Following World War II, Japanese generals were tried and convicted and hung and one of the charges against them was that they practiced waterboarding. Contrary to assertions made [by] some of the defenders, it produced little useful intelligence to help us track down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11th attacks or prevent new attacks and atrocities. I know from personal experience that the abuse of prisoners will produce more bad than good intelligence. I know that victims of torture will offer intentionally misleading information if they think their captors will believe it. I know they will say whatever they think their torturers want them to say if they believe it will stop their suffering. Most of all, I know the use of torture compromises that which most distinguishes us from our enemies \u2013 our belief that all people, even captured enemies, possess basic human rights which are protected by international conventions the United States not only joined but for the most part authored.

Mexico is going to pay for the wall, and it\u2019s very easy. The other politicians come down, \u201cYou can\u2019t get Mexico to pay for the wall.\u201d I said, \u201c100%.\u201d We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico. The wall is going to cost $10 billion to $12 billion. Okay? Believe me, they will pay. One of the officials \u2013 actually one of the ex-officials from Mexico had a news conference and he announced that \u201cWe will not be paying for the wall. Who does Mr. Trump think he is?\u201d They came to me \u2013 the press \u2013 these people. Look at all those cameras back there. The press came to me and they told me that \u201cHe said they would not pay for the wall. Do you have a comment?\u201d I said, \u201cYes. The wall just got 10 feet taller.\u201d It\u2019s true. And I love Mexico. I love Mexico. I love China. I love many of these countries that rip us off because we have leaders that are incompetent and don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. I love these countries and they\u2019re great. I have thousands and thousands of Hispanics. We\u2019re going to Nevada. I lead \u2013 I lead with the Hispanics. I\u2019m leading in every poll with the Hispanics. They love me. I love them. The problem is that the leaders of these countries, whether it\u2019s Mexico or Japan or Vietnam, which is just doing a big number now all of a sudden, or China in particular \u2013 that\u2019s the big one \u2013 the greatest abuse of a country that I think I\u2019ve ever seen financially \u2013 China \u2013 what they\u2019ve done to us is the greatest single theft in the history of the world. They\u2019ve taken our jobs. They\u2019ve taken our money. They\u2019ve taken everything. We\u2019re bringing our jobs back, folks. We\u2019re bringing our jobs back. We\u2019re going to bring them back, and I know how to do it. We\u2019ve had so many \u2013 we\u2019ve had so many incredible endorsements. And to me getting the greatest business people to endorse me is very important \u2013 Carl Icahn endorsed me. So many others have endorsed me. And we\u2019re going to put these great business people in charge of trade, and when China wants to come and negotiate, they\u2019re going to negotiate not with a political hack, which is what they have now, they\u2019re going to negotiate with the best business minds in the world and we have them in this country. So, we\u2019re going to do a lot of beautiful work. We\u2019re going to terminate Obamacare. It\u2019s going to be terminated. It\u2019s going to be over. It\u2019s going to be repealed, and it\u2019s going to be replaced and you\u2019re going to have much better health care at a much smaller cost. Because Obamacare \u2013 if you look \u2013 look at the increases in your Obamacare \u2013 25%, 35%, 45%, even 55%. It\u2019s dead. It\u2019s not working. We\u2019re going to go to a plan that\u2019s going to be so much better and so much less expensive. So, Second Amendment by the way this is a room loves the Second Amendment. Thank you, fellas. This is a room loves and cherishes the Second Amendment. We are going to protect our Second Amendment. Common Core is gone. We are getting rid of Common Core. We are bringing education to a local level. The people in this community \u2013 every time I see them, they want education locally. The parents, the teachers, they want to do it. They don\u2019t want bureaucrats telling them how to educate their children. We spend as a nation more for education per pupil than any other nation in the world. Not even close. More per pupil. Second place doesn\u2019t even exist it\u2019s so different. And yet, out of 30 countries, we\u2019re ranked number 30. You have China, you have Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and then you have number 30 \u2013 the United States. So we spend the most and we\u2019re at the bottom of the heap. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore, folks. Not going to happen anymore.

And I think we\u2019re going to do terrific there, and the SEC is going to be very, very exciting. We expect to do very, very well. I want to just say thank you to my family. It\u2019s been not easy for them. They don\u2019t see me anymore. I\u2019m making speeches all the time. And I have a great family. I really have a great family, so I just want to thank all of you.

It could even be before I\u2019m finished. But you know she insisted on being here. It was so important to Ivanka to insist on being here. So thank you\u2026 We have a wonderful lieutenant governor who backed us very early in the process. You know Henry [McMaster], right? The lieutenant governor of South Carolina. I will take him over the governor any time because we won. We won. He can handle that very nicely. He\u2019s tough. He\u2019s very tough. Tiffany, Eric, Laura, and Melania. Melania, say some. Go on.

The momentum since the beginning of this campaign has been unbelievable and that\u2019s because my father\u2019s message resonates so deeply with so many people. So, as our family, we\u2019re incredibly proud. We\u2019re incredibly grateful to each of you. So thank you for being here to support us. And I will say this: My father is an incredibly hard worker and he\u2019ll be working for each and every one of you. So together, we\u2019ll make America great again. So, you know, I was watching upstairs and it was really amazing to be watching what I was watching. And some of the pundits, you know, overall fair but not too much. But a number of the pundits said, \u201cWell, if a couple of the other candidates dropped out, if you add their scores together, it\u2019s going to equal Trump.\u201d These geniuses \u2013 they\u2019re geniuses \u2013 they don\u2019t understand that as people drop out, I\u2019m going to get a lot of those votes also.

But we\u2019re going to have to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals. I mean, our country is like a third world country. You go over to Qatar, you go over to some of these places in the Middle East. You go to China. You see the airports. You see the bridges. They have bridges that are so incredible you\u2019ve never seen anything like it. They have railroad trains that go 350 miles an hour and we have things that go chug, chug, chug, chug like from 100 years ago.

We protect Germany. We protect Japan. Do you know that in Japan if we get attacked, we have a treaty with Japan, if we get attacked they don\u2019t have to do anything. If they get attacked, we have World War III, we have to protect them. Okay? I mean, who makes these deals? We protect as an example South Korea, who have a maniac right next to them. Right? But we protect South Korea. So every time we order televisions, they come from South Korea, they make a fortune. We protect South Korea. Let me tell you something. Why aren\u2019t they paying? They pay peanuts for what we do. Every time this guy, you know, raises his head, we see our ships start to sail, our soldiers get ready. We have 28,000 soldiers at the border. So we take care of the world. We don\u2019t get it. Saudi Arabia, before the oil went down, they were making $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. And we rent space there so we can help them. We rent military bases. We pay rent. And yet without us they wouldn\u2019t last for two weeks. They\u2019d be gone. So we\u2019re going to change all that stuff folks. I mean, I want to be good. We want to be fair. We want to have heart. And we\u2019re not going to let these Syrian folks in that we don\u2019t know who they are. We don\u2019t know where they come from.

If a governor from a state didn\u2019t want to have them, I don\u2019t care what it says, you don\u2019t have to have them\u2026 We want to help them with safe zones. We want to get the Gulf States to pay. I don\u2019t want to pay. We owe $19 trillion. We owe enough. We can lead it but let the Gulf States \u2013 they have so much money they don\u2019t know what to do with it. Let them build safe zones. Look at what\u2019s happening in Germany. It\u2019s a mess. Look at Sweden. Look at Brussels. I mean, Brussels, you go there 20 years ago, 15 years ago it was incredible. So when I call for moratoriums and I call for this, first I get hit with tremendous heat. Right? Then everybody starts to say, \u201cYou know, he\u2019s right.\u201d Same thing \u2013 on June 16th, I announced we\u2019ve got to stop illegal immigration. The heat I took was unbelievable. Three, four weeks later they\u2019re all saying, you know, Trump is right. Then Kate killed in San Francisco, beautiful Kate, by an illegal immigrant. You have Jamiel in Los Angeles killed.

If you go back, you could see 2003, 2004, I said it\u2019s going to totally destabilize the Middle East because you had Iran and Iraq and they were the same militarily.

The worst, one of the dumbest deals I\u2019ve ever seen. I mean, we get nothing. We get nothing. We should have gotten those hostages before we started even negotiating. Not now.

Very simple. You build your plant in Mexico. Enjoy yourselves. And you\u2019re going to have air conditioners and just have them cross the border and sell them to the United States? No, you\u2019re going to pay a 35% tax on every air conditioner. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s the only thing you can do. And you know what? It\u2019s the only thing you can do.

You know, they\u2019re ordering Komatsu tractors now because they\u2019ve devalued \u2013 look, you take a look at what\u2019s happened to the Yen and it\u2019s very hard. A friend a mine. He\u2019s a big excavator. You all know excavators. I love excavators. This guy\u2019s a very big one. He buys Caterpillar tractors all the time and excavators. He just put in a big order for Komatsu. Not that he wanted to. He said, \u201cDonald, they made it impossible for me not to buy.

He wanted to buy Caterpillar\u2026 Well China is doing that times 100, times 1,000, and what they\u2019re doing is the devaluation of their currency makes it impossible for people to compete. We can\u2019t allow that stuff to happen. Look, when we send stuff over to China, it doesn\u2019t get in. If it does get in, you have to pay a big tax. You know, it\u2019s not supposed to be that way. You know, it\u2019s supposed to be free trade. It\u2019s supposed to be they come we go, back and forth. They devalued their currency and on top of it, they make it impossible. I have a friend who\u2019s a great manufacturer. He said it\u2019s virtually impossible to get his goods and he makes better stuff than they do. He can\u2019t get his goods into China. When he does get them in, there\u2019s a tax to pay.

But we purchase more drugs that make you better, drugs that make you better, not the kind of drugs that come over the southern border, which we\u2019re going to end. Okay? We\u2019re going to build a wall. Yup. Folks, by the way, we\u2019re going to build a wall and who\u2019s going to pay for the wall? You better believe it. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion. And these characters come up, these politicians that I\u2019m running against, \u201cYou don\u2019t really think Mexico is going to pay for the wall?\u201d I said, \u201cAbsolutely, 100%.\u201d They said, \u201cHow are you going to get Mexico to pay?\u201d And I don\u2019t want to get into it because they won\u2019t understand it. I mean, they have no concept of business. They have no \u2013 you know, the $150 billion we gave to Iran, these people have no concept. We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico. Okay? The wall is going to cost $12 billion. Maybe less. If I build it, it\u2019ll be taller, better, and less. Okay? So you think of this. So you think of this. So they said, \u201cHow are you going to possibly do it?\u201d They make so much money. Plus we give them subsidy. They make so much money from the United States it\u2019s going to be one of the easiest things.

He\u2019s very nice, good guy. I said, \u201cTell him the following. The wall just got 10 feet higher.\u201d I mean it. It got 10 feet higher. Yeah, they\u2019re going to pay for it. And I get along great with Mexico. The problem is \u2013 I mean, they buy apartments. I have hundreds and hundreds and even thousands of workers are Hispanics who I\u2019m doing great with. We have such an amazing relationship with Hispanics and they\u2019re great people. The problem is the leaders of Mexico are too smart for our leaders. They\u2019re too smart. They\u2019re too cunning. You look at what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s unbelievable. The border is a disaster. It\u2019s a sieve. People flow over. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore, folks.

They\u2019re moving their big plant from Chicago to Mexico. Ford, they\u2019re moving this massive complex \u2013 they\u2019re building a $2.5 billion plant and now they\u2019ve just announced they\u2019re building it bigger. I\u2019ve been talking about this for two years. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal, they announced they\u2019re building it bigger. In another words, they\u2019re doubling down. You know why? Nobody does anything about it. I\u2019m going to do something about it. So I watched \u2013 somebody asked, \u201cWhat would you do about Carrier?\u201d Because that was a sad case. Somebody used their cell phone and they were telling them, \u201cYou\u2019re out of work. You\u2019re out of job. Forget it. It\u2019s over. We\u2019re moving to Mexico.\u201d Are crying. Grown men that have been there for a long time. Really incredible people. And they\u2019re crying and they\u2019re devastated and they lost their job and they\u2019ve never had another job and now this plant \u2013 this whole thing is moving to Mexico.

Amazing people. And then we come down here and I said, \u201cYou know, I think we have an ever bigger lead over here.\u201d And the people have been incredible no matter where we go to speak. Even this. I know that four years ago, you had about 200 people here for the same kind of thing for your frontrunner and he\u2019s a good frontrunner, a good guy, and he did well but you had 400 people, 200 people. You have thousands of people here and we just appreciate it, and I won\u2019t forget it. Believe me, I\u2019m not going to forget it. I\u2019m not going to forget it. So I hear that they\u2019re talking about trying to get a liberal judge and a judge that does not like the Second Amendment and a judge that \u2013 and this is one of many. This is one of many but a judge that doesn\u2019t want to do a number on the guns and that doesn\u2019t know how important it is. We\u2019re just not going to let it happen. Okay? It\u2019s not going happen. And if we elected, we know that. But we have 9 months, 10 months to go. We have to have the Republicans hold fast because I\u2019m just hearing these little cracks, saying \u201cWell, maybe if he appoints somebody, maybe we could get along, maybe.\u201d It\u2019s not the way it\u2019s supposed to be. Now, it\u2019s possible that they\u2019ll have their wish because if they win, they\u2019re going to be having their choice. But if they don\u2019t win, we\u2019re going to start really taking back because we have 3 or 4 or 5 maybe Supreme Court judges. This was not supposed to be one in question. This was a very sad circumstance that happened with \u2013 I mean, really to me it was a very sad circumstance. But now we\u2019re going to see what happens. I will only tell you this. We are doing well. We have a really good chance to win. If we can win in South Carolina, we\u2019re going to go \u2013 I mean, we could very well run the table. I don\u2019t know if you saw \u2013 I guess a lot of you have seen actually next week in Nevada. It\u2019s going to be phenomenal. The relationship there to the people\u2026Bush is 1% in Nevada. This guy \u2013 why doesn\u2019t he just give up, just go home? Go home. Go home to mom. Got to go home to mommy. You know, Bush is only at 1% in Nevada. A couple of them are, you know, at 10%, 11%, or 12%. I\u2019m at like 40% something \u2013 48%. So I think we\u2019re going to do well. Then I think we have the SEC. We\u2019re going to have the SEC, which is going to be I think amazing. But really now we\u2019re starting. New Hampshire could not have been better. They gave us a tremendous send-off. They really started us on our way. And we did well in Iowa. I mean, some votes were stolen from Ben Carson, which by the way was a disgrace. What Cruz \u2013 what this guy Cruz did with Ben Carson was an absolute disgrace. What he did was \u2013 he stole. It\u2019s theft. And then they come out with a voter violation form, which is a fraud as far as I\u2019m concerned. And what he did with that whole thing was a disgrace. So we\u2019re not going to let that stuff happen anymore. I mean, we\u2019re not going to let it. We will not let it happen. We\u2019re all watching. You\u2019re all watching. Keep your eyes wide open. These politicians \u2013 here\u2019s a guy, he raises the Bible and yet he tells fibs, he tells lies, and then he does this stuff to Carson and he does other things. Very bad. So politicians are bad people. Boy, they are bad. Would you believe it? So we\u2019re not going to let it happen and we\u2019re going to get in there\u2026So Saturday. Go out and vote. This is going to be the place that\u2019s really going to make it. And honestly, I\u2019ve been watching all the pundits. Now, the bad news is they\u2019re always wrong. They all said I\u2019m not running and I ran. Well, how is he going to do? He\u2019s just doing this for fun. I\u2019m not doing this for fun. Believe me, I love this location but I know I can be someplace else. Okay? I could be someplace else right now. I could be very happy.

Second Amendment.\u201d Now, the Second Amendment means a lot of other things too\u2026The Second Amendment in under siege. You know that. You know that very well. We lost a great Supreme Court justice and nobody thought this was going to be part of the equation.

It\u2019s not going to happen. \u2026But we lost our wonderful justice who was a great man and a great Second Amendment person. I just heard coming up, you know, the Senators. We\u2019ve been very disappointed. I\u2019m a Republican. Many of you are Republicans. But we\u2019re not being protected whether it\u2019s a budget. You saw the budget that was approved a month ago. It was approved by the Republicans. They gave it away. They gave Obama everything. So Obama wants to put in a Supreme Court judge. He said he wants \u2013 he\u2019s going to be a very negative person to guns because that\u2019s the way it is, okay? Believe me, that will be the way it is.

What\u2019s going to happen?\u201d And coming up today, I hear, \u201cWell, there could be a way of Obama pushing it through.\u201d Here we go, right? Here we go. Same thing you heard with Obamacare. It\u2019s going to be defeated. It\u2019s going to be repealed. We\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Believe me. But \u2013 I mean, look what\u2019s going on with your premiums. 35%, 45%, 55% up. Your deductible is so high. I mean, you\u2019ve got to see that truck right there? You\u2019ve got to get hit by that truck in order to ever use it. So, I come up and I\u2019m hearing that Obama now who said by the way yesterday, \u201cDonald Trump will not be the president. He will not be.\u201d No, it\u2019s a compliment. Look, he\u2019s been perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States. So it\u2019s a compliment.

I am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. Remember that. Don\u2019t believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9% and 5% unemployment. The number\u2019s probably 28%, 29%, as high as 35%. In fact, I even heard recently 42%. Do you think we\u2019d have gathering like this if we had \u2013 if we had 5% unemployment, do you think we\u2019d have these gatherings?

For me, it\u2019s been a very long process. As you know, we had our no B.S. Backyard Barbecues. We had 10 of the candidates over the house grab a beer and a hot dog and actually kind of meet, listen, learn and understand what they\u2019re going to offer this country and New Hampshire in particular. And one common theme came about throughout the whole process. I\u2019m saying to myself, \u201cWhat is the biggest problem right now in Washington?\u201d Well, it\u2019s clearly the dysfunction in Washington, the fact that they don\u2019t talk, they don\u2019t work together. Very rarely does anything get done. And the one person who has the independence and can be the change agent to actually get Washington working again, it was very clear to me that that was Donald Trump. In addition, when you\u2019re looking at somebody who\u2019s actually had the opportunity to create jobs, who\u2019s actually has had a real job in the private sector, who\u2019s actually signed the front of a check and not just the back of the check, someone who can actually bring people together, put the men in a room, shut the door and actually negotiate some type of arrangement or settlement or conclusion to a very important matter affecting our country, whether it\u2019d be dealing with our national security, our economic security, cybersecurity, you name it, and once again, it came back to Donald Trump.

I\u2019m really honored. And I want to congratulate Ted, and I want to congratulate all of the incredible candidates, including Mike Huckabee, who\u2019s become a really good friend of mine.

And we\u2019re just so happy with the way everything worked out. And most importantly, I have to thank my wife and Lara and Eric and Vanessa and Don. They went out and they were doing speeches. And in fact, Don and Eric, I think you did about six speeches today. So, I just want to thank my family. They have been so amazing and so supportive. And we\u2019ve had every indication \u2013 we\u2019re going now on \u2013 we have a poll we\u2019re at 28 points ahead. Okay? New Hampshire \u2013 we love New Hampshire. We love South Carolina.

I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with Hillary\u2019s got other problems, maybe bigger than the problems she\u2019s got in terms of nominations. But we\u2019ve had so many different indications and polls that we beat her and we beat her easily. And we will go on to get the Republican nomination and we will go on to easily beat Hillary or Bernie or whoever the hell they throw up there. Iowa, we love you. We thank you. You\u2019re special.

I\u2019m a little bit of a rebel. But you have to be able to get along with people. We have to build up our country again. Our country is absolutely falling apart. $19 trillion in debt. Tremendous deficits. Our \u2013 believe me. The real number in jobs is not 5.2%. It\u2019s probably in the 25% category because when somebody gives up looking for a job as you know they\u2019re statistically taken off the rolls. So we have to build up our country. To do that, you have to get along. At least you\u2019d have to have a semblance of something. People don\u2019t like Ted Cruz. They don\u2019t like him. And when you say why am I doing better with the evangelicals than Ted Cruz? Because they like me better than Ted Cruz. And they understand I am a Christian. I\u2019m a good Christian. And the evangelicals have figured that out very easily and very quickly\u2026 Question: \n[Inaudible]\n You know, I\u2019ve had a great life. I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of people. I\u2019ve given them jobs. That means education. That means health care. I\u2019ve been very proud of it. I\u2019ve built an unbelievable company, just an unbelievable one. When I filed with the FEC, all of you people ran down because you were trying to say \u201cWell, maybe he\u2019s not as big as people think\u201d and it turned out that it was much bigger. I have some of the great assets of the world. I have very little debt. I have tremendous cash flow. And I say that only because that\u2019s what our country needs. That\u2019s what our country needs. Our country needs that kind of thinking. We have $19 trillion. $19 trillion. Think of it. Trillion. We have $19 trillion in debt with a horrible budget deal that was just made. Horrible deal. That\u2019s adding another \u2013 at least another $2 trillion. We\u2019re going to be at $21 trillion in debt. We\u2019re spending money like a bunch of people that don\u2019t have any clues as to what\u2019s happening. We have leadership that\u2019s incompetent. We have leadership that in many respects is stupid. When I hear Kerry the other day say that well some of the $19 billion \u2013 okay? \u2013 some of it\u2026the money that they got back \u2013 the $150 billion \u2013 some of it is going to be spent for terror, like routinely it\u2019s going to be spent for terror. And you know, it\u2019s interesting. They ordered supposedly I read today \u2013 they\u2019re spending all their money in Europe. Iran is spending all of this money in Europe. They ordered 114 Airbus jets made in Europe. Where\u2019s Boeing? Where\u2019s Boeing? Why aren\u2019t they buying Boeing? Why don\u2019t we have provisions where they have to buy our product? So when I look at the stupidity of our leadership in this country \u2013 and that goes from the border to trade to health care to everything \u2013 I say I have no choice. I love my life.

What\u2019s going to happen over the next period of time, nothing\u2019s going to be nice. Nothing\u2019s going to be easy. But Ted is a wreck. And the reason he\u2019s a wreck is because he doesn\u2019t know if he even \u2013 he has checked and he\u2019s a good lawyer. He doesn\u2019t know himself whether or not he has the legal right to run and to serve as president. Now, how can you vote for somebody when you know the Democrats are going to bring a suit? There\u2019s a cloud on title. It\u2019s called in real estate cloud on title. Here it\u2019s a cloud over his head. Nobody knows whether or not he can even run for office. I tend to doubt it. Some great constitutional lawyers are now saying he doesn\u2019t have the right to serve. He cannot run and serve as president of the United States. That\u2019s a problem. I also did not like the fact that on his financial disclosure form, it\u2019s a big problem. He\u2019s going to be Robin Hood. He\u2019s going to protect everybody. Not to mention a couple of little facts. The banks. Right? He didn\u2019t put them in. Now, why didn\u2019t he put Goldman Sachs in? Why didn\u2019t he put Citicorp in? He didn\u2019t put them in. He said he forgot. He also said he didn\u2019t know that he was a Canadian citizen 15 months ago. How come he didn\u2019t know? He\u2019s a smart guy. He said, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know I was.\u201d He didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t know that he was a Canadian citizen. So he was born in Canada, he was a Canadian citizen, and 15 months ago he renounced his citizenship. So he probably has a first. He was the first Canadian citizen ever to be a senator in this country \u2013 a senator from Texas. But he didn\u2019t know he was a Canadian. He was a joint U.S.-Canadian citizen. He was a Canadian citizen. He didn\u2019t know that he was a Canadian citizen?

Sheriff Joe understand that probably better than anybody as he\u2019s done a great job and he\u2019s been given very little resource.

They could be ISIS. They could be \u2013 we don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s got to stop. We owe $19 trillion as a country. We have people running our country that are incompetent.

We don\u2019t make deals. Not with Fox. Not with anybody. We don\u2019t make deals. You have a dealmaker for the country. The country needs somebody that knows what they\u2019re doing because we\u2019re a country that is adrift. We\u2019re a country that doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing at the top. When you look at the Iran deal, when you look at the Bergdahl deal, when you look at any single thing they are doing, we are adrift. We have no idea what we\u2019re doing as a country and it\u2019s a problem. Question: \n[Inaudible]\n \u2026And I said \u2013 what did I say? You didn\u2019t read it.

I\u2019ve succeeded.\u201d He says. And he says, \u201cI want you to succeed too.\u201d And that is refreshing because he as he builds things, he builds big things, things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work. He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard hats and the steel-toed boots and the work ethics that you all have within you. He being an optimist, passionate about equal opportunity to work. The self-made success of his, you know that he doesn\u2019t get his power, his high off of opium, other people\u2019s money like a lot of dopes in Washington do. They\u2019re addicted to opium where they take other people\u2019s money and then their high is getting to redistribute it. Right? And then they get to be really popular people when they get to give out your hard money. Well, he doesn\u2019t do that. His power, his passion is the fabric of America and it\u2019s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the Almighty. What a combination. Are you ready to share in that again, Iowa? Because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to let you make America great again. He\u2019s going to be able to empower you to look out for one another again instead of relying on a bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you. No. And I think you\u2019re ready for that. And Iowa, I believe too that you\u2019re ready to see that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this country. And you\u2019re ready for the tax reform he talks about to open up Main Street again. And you\u2019re ready to stop the race-baiting and the division based on color and zip code to unify around the right issues \u2013 the issues important to me or I wouldn\u2019t be endorsing him. Pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, strict constitutionality. Those things that are unifying values and they\u2019re time-tested truths involved. These are unifying values from big cities and tiny towns, from big mountain states and the Big Apple to the big beautiful heartland that\u2019s in between. Now, finally friends, I want you to try to picture this. It\u2019s a nice thing to picture. Exactly one year from tomorrow, former President Barack Obama, he packs up the teleprompters and the selfie sticks and the Greek columns and all that hope-y, change-y stuff and he heads on back to Chicago where I\u2019m sure he can find some community there to organize again. There he can finally look up \u2013 President Obama will be able to look up and there over his head he\u2019ll be able to see that shining towering Trump Tower. Yes, Barack, he built that and that says a lot. Iowa, you say a lot being here tonight supporting the right man who will allow you to make America great again. God bless you.

They need to get used to it. This election is more than just your basic ABCs \u2013 anybody but Clinton. It\u2019s more than that this go-around. When we\u2019re talking about a nation without borders, when we\u2019re talking about bankruptcies and our federal government, debt that our children and our grandchildren they\u2019ll never be able to pay off, when we\u2019re talking about no more Reagan-esque power that comes from strength \u2013 power through strength \u2013 well, then we\u2019re talking about our very existence. So no, we\u2019re not going to chill. In fact, it\u2019s time to drill, baby, drill down and hold these folks accountable. And we need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new and independent \u2013 a candidate who represents that and represents America first finally \u2013 pro-Constitution, common sense solutions that he brings to the table. Yes, the status quo has got to go. Otherwise, we\u2019re just going to get more of the same. And with their failed agenda, it can\u2019t be salvaged; it must be savaged, and Donald Trump is the right one to do that. Are you ready for new? And are you ready for the leader who will let you make America great again? It\u2019s going to take a whole team. It\u2019s going to take a whole team \u2013 fighters, all of us in the private sector, fighters in the House and the Senate. So, our friends who are fighters in the House and the Senate today they need to stay there and help out. They can help our new leaders in the positions they are in. Let me say something really positive about one of those individuals. Rand Paul. I\u2019m going to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is healthy because he knows you only go to war if you\u2019re determined to win the war. And you quit footing the bill for these nations who are oil rich. We\u2019re paying for some of their skirmishes that have been going on for centuries where they\u2019re fighting each other and yelling \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and calling jihad on each other\u2019s heads forever and ever. Like I said before, let them duke it out and let Allah sort it out. We\u2019ll fight for American interests as Donald Trump has said other nations where we have been footing the bill but we haven\u2019t prioritized our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to afford what we\u2019re doing overseas. Things are going to change under President Trump. So we can be an unbeatable team with fighters there in the House and the Senate. Yeah, our leader is a little bit different. He\u2019s a multi-billionaire. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that. But it\u2019s amazing. He is not elitist at all. Oh, I just hope you get to know him as a person and a family man and what he\u2019s been able to accomplish and with his \u2013 it\u2019s kind of this quiet generosity. Yeah, maybe his largesse kind of \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 some would say gets in the way of that quiet generosity and his compassion. But if you know him as a person and you\u2019ll get to know him more and more, you\u2019ll have even more respect not just for his record of success and the good intentions for America but who he is as a person. He\u2019s not an elitist. And yes as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on because he roots us on.

Now, would the left ever \u2013 would the DNC ever come after their frontrunner and her supporters? No. Because they don\u2019t eat their own. They don\u2019t self-destruct. But for the GOP establishment to be coming after Donald Trump\u2019s supporters even with accusations that are so false? They are so busted the way that this thing works. We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they would attack.

And all these new Democratic voters that are going to be coming on over the border as we keep the borders open? And bequeathing our children millions in new debt and refusing to fight back for our solvency and our sovereignty even though that\u2019s why we elected them and sent them as a majority to DC? No. If they\u2019re not willing to do that then how are they to tell us that we\u2019re not conservative enough in order to be able to make these changes in America that we know need to be made. Now? They\u2019re concerned about this ideological purity? Give me a break! Who are they to say that? Oh and tell somebody like Phyllis Schlafly. She is the Republican conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter. Tell her she\u2019s not conservative. How about the rest of us? Right wing and bitter clinging crowd clingers of our guns, our God and our religions and our Constitution. Tell us we\u2019re not red enough? Yeah, coming from the establishment, right. Well, he being the only one who\u2019s willing \u2013 he\u2019s got the guts to wear the issues that need to be spoken about and debated on his sleeves. Where the rest of some of these establishment candidates they just wanted to duck and hide. They didn\u2019t want to talk about these issues until he brought them up. In fact, they\u2019ve been wearing this political correctness kind of like a suicide vest. And enough is enough. These issues that Donald Trump talked about had to be debated and he brought them to the forefront and that\u2019s why we are where we are today with good discussion, a good heated and very competitive primary is where we are.

Okay? Well, Trump, what he has been able to do, which is really ticking people off, which I\u2019m glad about. He\u2019s going rogue left and right, man. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been doing so well.

I want you guys to understand more and more how the system \u2013 the establishment works and has gotten us into the troubles that we are in in America. The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their campaign donor class and that\u2019s why you see that the borders are kept open for them, for their cheap labor that they want to come in. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been bloating budgets \u2013 it\u2019s for crony capitalists to be able to suck off of them. It\u2019s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere. We need someone new who has the power and is in the position to bust up that establishment to make things great again. It\u2019s part of the problem. His candidacy, which is a movement \u2013 it\u2019s a force, it\u2019s a strategy.

Look, back there in the press box heads are spinning. Media heads are spinning. This is going to be so much fun. Are you ready to make America great again? We all have a part in this. We all have a responsibility. Looking around at all of you you hardworking Iowa families, you farm families and teachers and teamsters and cops and cooks, you rock and rollers and holy rollers. All of you who work so hard. You full time moms. You with the hands that rock the cradle. You all make the world go around and now our cause is won. When asked why I would jump into a primary, trying to stir it up a little maybe, and choose one over some friends who are running and I\u2019ve endorsed a couple of others in their races before they \u2013 [inaudible] \u2013 I was told, you know, warned left and right, \u201cYou are going to get so clobbered in the press. You are just going to get beat up and chewed up and spit out.\u201d And you know, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cAnd\u2026?\u201d Yeah. You know, like you guys haven\u2019t tried to do that everyday since that night in \u201908 when I was on stage nominated for VP and I got to say, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go. Send me. You betcha.

A new commander-in-chief who will never leave our men behind. A new commander-in-chief one who will never lie to the families of the fallen. I\u2019m in it because just last week we\u2019re watching our sailors suffer and be humiliated on a world stage at the hands of Iranian captors in violation of international law because a weak knee capitulator-in-chief has decided that America will lead from behind. And he who would negotiate deals kind of with the skills of a community organizer may be organizing the neighborhood tea, well, he deciding that no, America would apologize and as part of the deal as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the world that they capture and we kowtow and we apologize and then we bend over and say \u201cThank you, enemy.\u201d We are ready for a change. We are ready and our troops deserve the best \u2013 a new commander-in-chief whose track record of success has proven he is the master at the art of the deal, he is one who would know to negotiate. Only candidate\u2019s record of success proves he is the master of the art of the deal. He is beholden to no one but we the people. How refreshing.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a campaign rally in Ames, Iowa on Jan. 19, 2016. Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed Trump following his remarks. So very, very big on the Second Amendment. But what happened is all of a sudden after Paris and to an extent, to a pretty big extent in California, what happened is these polls started coming in where everybody liked Trump even more. I went up 11 points. I don\u2019t want to do it for that reason. But it went up because people want strength just like having the family of John Wayne, who was great. I love John Wayne. From Iowa. But out of nowhere I got the most beautiful letter from his daughter, who you just met, who\u2019s an incredible woman, and she said, \u201cWe\u2019d like to endorse you.\u201d John Wayne was a strong guy. We need strength. We need strength in this country because we\u2019re withering away with political correctness nonsense. Okay? Nonsense. I mean, if you think of it, you can\u2019t say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d anymore. We\u2019re going to say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d again. You go into these department stores. They don\u2019t have any Christmas displays. They don\u2019t have the sign \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d. Even people that aren\u2019t Christian are saying \u201cMerry Christmas. We love Christmas. Let us say \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019, Happy Holidays.\u201d But people like to see it. And stores don\u2019t put it up anymore. We\u2019re withering away. We\u2019re going in the wrong direction. So I said we\u2019re going to do this and I had no idea it was going to work this way. I figured I\u2019d be in the pack and maybe like a race horse. You know, just at the end you can sort of inch it out. I had no idea to have 21 point leads nationally. We\u2019re up by so much. And you know, I want to keep it that way. I want to keep it that way. When you think \u2013 and just one thing before I introduce our incredible person, our incredible guest. But one thing \u2013 I\u2019ve spent to this point almost nothing and I\u2019m in first place by a lot. I tell this story. I\u2019m not bragging about spending. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m telling the story. I have spent \u2013 they\u2019ll tell you \u2013 almost nothing and I\u2019m in first place by some polls have me 21 points. That\u2019s a lot. Okay? You know some people have 2%. I have a lead of 20%. But I\u2019m in first place by a lot. Jeb has spent now $77 million. Think of it. And you know the reason I bring him up \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t even bring him up \u2013 but he spends a fortune on ads against me. You people have all seen it before I got along with everybody. I contributed to everybody. I was a world class businessman. Now I\u2019m a politician, which I\u2019d hate to tell you. But you go with everybody. You want to love everybody. You want them all to love you unless you\u2019re stupid. But you want everybody to love you. Everybody knows this story. But so much money has been spent on me. But he spent $79 million. I spend nothing. I\u2019m in first by a lot. He\u2019s down towards the bottom of the pack. And I said to myself, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Wouldn\u2019t that be great if this were the country doing this?\u201d As an example, education. We\u2019re number 28 in the world. We have third world countries that are ahead of us. Education is very important to me. World, I mean, countries that you wouldn\u2019t believe are ahead of us. You wouldn\u2019t believe if you heard the names of some of these countries. So we\u2019re 28. But we\u2019re number one in spending per pupil by far. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you had like this election process where we spent the least but we had the best education? You know? So Sweden and Norway and China and others are the best. We\u2019re nowhere near them and yet we spend far more per pupil. So we\u2019re going to change that and I told you we\u2019re going to get it localized but we\u2019re going to change that. Watch, you just watch\u2026 I will tell you this: You can\u2019t educate your children through bureaucrats in Washington. And that\u2019s what happens with Common Core. When the parents take over and I really mean this because I\u2019ve seen it. When the parents surround those schools and they love those kids and they love those pupils and even when their kids graduate, they are committed to those schools, they\u2019re committed to education. You can do so much better in Iowa than they can possibly do telling you what to do in Washington. And not all of them but most of them are just interested in \u201cWhere\u2019s my check? How much do I get? Let\u2019s make the process complicated.\u201d And some of the things that your kids are made to study are an outrage. Okay? So we\u2019re going to bring that back locally and it\u2019s going to be great. So what happened essentially is I started looking and all of a sudden things changed. And people are now looking. They know I\u2019ll do great with China. I\u2019m going to do great with Japan. I\u2019m going to do great with Mexico, who\u2019s killing us in trade and killing us also at the border. We will build a wall and you know who\u2019s going to pay for the wall \u2013 Mexico. They\u2019re going to pay for it because they make a fortune and all of those things. But now, we\u2019re really focused on security and I\u2019m honored because I will tell you that all of polls and the CNN polls where said in particular that Trump is just not by a little bit but by many, many percentage points winning on ISIS, winning on the military, winning with the vets. We\u2019re going to take care of our vets big league, by the way. Big league. Big league. And we\u2019re going to really take care of our military. It\u2019s going to be big and strong and powerful and nobody\u2019s going to mess with us and it\u2019s the cheapest thing we can do, I\u2019ll tell you that right now. So it\u2019s been a real focus. I just want to now say just a couple of words about a very special person. This is a person who I\u2019ve known for a long time, who I\u2019ve respected for so long. An incredible husband. An incredible family. And somebody that when I heard that she was going to endorse me, I was so honored. You have no idea how honored.

They don\u2019t have to develop nuclear missiles. They can buy them. For the kind of money we gave them, they\u2019re going to buy them. Why are they going to develop?  Remember the deal? 24 days.

And you know, for years, they would fight. For many, many years, for decades they\u2019d fight, fight, fight. Nobody would win. Fight. They\u2019d rest. Then they\u2019d go back to fight. And now, we gave them the second largest oil reserves in the world, which is Iraq. We gave it to them. Now, they\u2019re going into Yemen. And if you look at Yemen, take a look. They\u2019re going to get Syria. They\u2019re going to get Yemen. Unless, you know, trust me a lot of good things are going to happen if I get in. But let\u2019s just sort of leave it the way it is. They get Syria. They get Yemen. Now, they didn\u2019t want Yemen. But did you ever see the border between Yemen and Saudi Arabia? They want Saudi Arabia. So, what are they going to have? They\u2019re going to have Iraq. They\u2019re going to have Iran. They\u2019re going to have Iraq.  They\u2019re going to have Yemen. They\u2019re going to have Syria.

It\u2019s going to be easy. It\u2019s going to be easy. So, I started and I talked about the border. Very strong on immigration and illegal immigration. Took a lot of heat. But you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about that subject if I didn\u2019t bring it up. And I talked about again I talked about ISIS and I talked about. But what really happened is after Paris we had 130 people killed. And by the way, I told you Common Core is dead and Second Amendment is right this way. We\u2019re going to protect the Second Amendment. We\u2019re going to protect the guns. We\u2019re going to protect your guns. You know, if in Paris and if in Los Angeles, we had the two maniacs that were married. She came on a fiancee permit\u2026You know, wonderful fiancee. She was totally radicalized. Maybe radicalized him. Maybe he was already that way. But we\u2019ve got to start thinking. We have to start using our head. Bad stuff is happening. We have to find out what\u2019s going on. We have a president who won\u2019t even talk about the term. If you think, he won\u2019t even mention anything to do with what we all know is going on. And you can\u2019t solve the problem if you don\u2019t talk about it. You have to talk about it. So, very, very strongly we started talking about that. And then after Paris \u2013 and by the way, if we had a couple of you and you and you and you, if we had three or four people in that room in Paris as an example where they have the toughest gun laws like in the world. You can\u2019t have a gun unless you\u2019re bad guy, you bought a gun. And they walked in just said \u201cBoom! Boom! Boom! You, move over. Boom!\u201d Killed 130, more to follow because there are people that are so badly wounded. But if we had a couple of \u2013 few of the people that I pointed out \u2013 I could plenty in this audience, believe me. But if they had guns on their waist, if they had guns around their ankle where the bullets went the opposite direction, it would have been a whole different story, folks. It\u2019d be a whole different story. ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in Ames, Iowa \u2013 Part 5"}, {"text": "Part 4 of 6. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a campaign rally in Ames, Iowa on Jan. 19, 2016. Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed Trump following his remarks. Now, yours is a little more complicated because the caucus system is a little bit different. It\u2019s a very interesting system. But it is different. Here\u2019s what I have to say about Iowa. It\u2019s very important. So you know there\u2019s a movement to move Iowa to the back of the pack. Okay? You know that. You\u2019ll still see me but you won\u2019t see other people. Believe me. I\u2019m loyal. To a fault I\u2019m loyal. But you\u2019re going to see. I give you my word. I win; they\u2019re not touching Iowa. This is an amazing tradition. No, seriously. This is an amazing tradition. They\u2019re not moving Iowa back. And they\u2019re not moving New Hampshire either because they\u2019re talking about Iowa, New Hampshire. They\u2019re not touching New Hampshire. So, we\u2019re going to just keep it the way it is. It really is. It\u2019s an amazing. First of all, you\u2019re amazing people. But all over the country it\u2019s a movement all over the country. The people are incredible. They want to make America great again. They\u2019re going to do something that\u2019s special. And you know we used to talk silent majority? I say it\u2019s the noisy majority because it\u2019s actually a noisy majority. It\u2019s not a silent majority. But people are fed up. So I started on June 16th and we did well. Practically from the beginning we went up. And if you remember, we started at nothing. You know, we started at nothing because nobody believed I was going to [run]. Even when they \u2013 my wife said, \u201cYou know if you run, you\u2019re going to win.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to run.\u201d At the polls. I was getting these little polls. I felt like some of these guys now that are senators and governors; they get these little polls. \u2026Jeb again, right? Boy, he\u2019s taking a lot of abuse. You know? I told him \u201cYou know what? You should use the name Bush. What\u2019s wrong? Use the name Bush. I mean, maybe it\u2019s not working but it\u2019s better than Jeb right?\u201d You know, I really do. Get rid of the exclamation point and just put Jeb Bush. It\u2019s your name. Don\u2019t be ashamed of your name. So anyways, I wish him the best. But, you know, I started and I started at like 2% or 3% and then it went to 6% and then it went to 9%. And each time the pundits \u2013 these real geniuses back here \u2013 some of them are sitting back here \u2013 these real geniuses like George Will with the little glasses \u2013 take away the glasses. He looks like a dumb guy, I\u2019m telling you. But each time these geniuses would say, \u201cWell, he\u2019s reached his plateau. He\u2019s plateaued\u201d at 6%, right? Then it goes to 11%. \u201cWell, you know, this is surprising but he\u2019s reached his plateau.\u201d And then it goes to 18%. And then it went to 22%, 24%, 28%, then it went to 32%. Then it went actually 42% in the Gravis poll and in Reuters we got to 42% and even a little above that. And then all of a sudden you didn\u2019t hear so much about the plateau. I want to plateau at 42%. You know, 42% with like 14 people that\u2019s pretty good. But they kept saying, \u201cHe\u2019s plateaued. That\u2019s all he\u2019ll get. He\u2019s got these followers.\u201d We have the smartest followers there are. Number one, we have the smartest. And the hardest working followers. We have people that love the country more than anybody and they want to take back what\u2019s happened because our country is going to hell. We can be nice about it. We can say it nice and soft. Our country is going to hell. When you look at this crazy Iran deal where we\u2019re paying $150 billion and they give us the five back but they don\u2019t know where the fifth is and you understand what that means. That\u2019s not a good sign. But they give us five people but they get seven and they get 14 off the Interpol. These are bad dudes. They get 14 plus seven so they\u2019re getting 21 people. And they have the right to do whatever they want from an enterprise standpoint. Right to do oil. Right to do whatever they want.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a campaign rally in Ames, Iowa on Jan. 19, 2016. Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed Trump following his remarks. \u2026So South Carolina just came out and that\u2019s 32% for Trump, 18% for second, 11% for third. Great. Florida leading by a lot \u2013 31%, 19%, 13%, and then all down in the dumps. Georgia just came out. I have 33%. Yeah, don\u2019t forget that\u2019s 33%. Hard to believe. That\u2019s with 14 people, 15 people. I don\u2019t know when they took it but it was recent. 33%. Connecticut \u2013 now, Tom Brady loves me and that\u2019s sort of like, you know, and I love Tom Brady by the way. 35% to 18% to 9% to 2%. You know, to nothing. Maryland just came out. Maryland \u2013 great place \u2013 32% to 15% to 11% to 9% and then you know they sort of phase out. You ever hear of a place called Iowa? Oh, I love this. We\u2019re doing actually great. First of all, I have to tell you. You know, they never report it. Even CNN doesn\u2019t report it. CNN does a poll, probably spent millions, they never report their poll. The CNN poll was 33% for Trump, 20% for Chris. Nobody talks about it. Nobody talks about it. They don\u2019t talk about it. They talk about \u2013 CNN is reporting other people\u2019s polls. So, I call up. I say, \u201cWait a minute. You\u2019re CNN. You spent a fortune on polls and you don\u2019t report your own polls because I\u2019m winning by a lot.\u201d And they have no excuse but they keep reporting other polls. But we\u2019re doing well. I think we\u2019re doing a lot better than anyone knows. Gravis just came out \u2013 34% for Trump, 28% for Cruz. PPP 28% for Trump, 26% for Cruz. In other words, it\u2019s a little close here. Quinnipiac poll \u2013 very respected 31% for Trump, 29% for Cruz. And then again CNN 33% to 20%. So we\u2019re \u2013 I think we\u2019re doing good. I think we\u2019re actually doing better than the polls. Now, I could do this. I could say, \u201cWell, I just want to do well in Iowa.\u201d I want to win Iowa, folks. Because look, I love the people. The evangelicals have been phenomenal. I\u2019m doing great with the evangelicals but nationwide I\u2019m winning with evangelical \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you know that \u2013 by a lot nationwide. With Iowa, I\u2019m doing really well with the evangelicals. We\u2019re doing really well with the Tea Party. We\u2019re doing well \u2013 I mean, you hear the numbers. I mean, these are the numbers. But I actually think we\u2019re doing even better than the polls. And you know, there\u2019s the thing that a lot of people said, you know, they call up, \u201cAre you going to vote for Trump? He\u2019s got very, very tough immigration policies. He wants to destroy Obamacare and replace it with something a lot better.\u201d I\u2019m going to do that. Okay? But you know, a lot of people, they\u2019ll pick up the phone and they\u2019ll hear different things and they\u2019ll say, \u201cUh, no I\u2019ll vote for \u2013 \u201c and then they\u2019d get in the booth and they say, \u201cTrump is my man.\u201d There are a lot of people saying that we\u2019re going to do a lot better. But we\u2019ll see because Feb. 1st you have to get to caucus, you have to go out. You\u2019ve got to do it. Otherwise, we\u2019ve all wasted our time. You know, one of the groups in Maine and it was like incredible. We were in different places up in New England recently and New Hampshire was amazing. And the people are standing there. It was so cold. There was one little group of \u2013 despite global warming \u2013 you know, you hear about \u201cIt was so cold.\u201d It was windchill below zero. And people were standing outside for hours trying to get in. And then you hear the announcers. \u201cWell, will they show up to vote?\u201d And I don\u2019t know much but I say like if people are going to stand out for four hours in the cold or the heat because believe me they stood out in the heat during the summer and during the fall like you wouldn\u2019t believe in Tennessee, in Texas where we had 21,000 people, no matter where we go we have these big crowds but they\u2019ll stand for hours and hours to get in. Why aren\u2019t they going to go and vote? Or in your case caucus? Why aren\u2019t they going to go and vote? It\u2019s sort of an amazing thing. So we think they\u2019re going to really be \u2013 why would somebody wait for hours for four hours and not going to take two minutes to vote?

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s remarks at a campaign rally in Ames, Iowa on Jan. 19, 2016. Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed Trump following his remarks. And I filed the financials and they saw an unbelievable \u2013 you didn\u2019t hear a thing about it. Oh boy, were they looking. I mean, were they looking. And almost 100 pages. The biggest report ever filed with the FEC in terms of that. And it showed a company that\u2019s a phenomenal company with some of the great assets, very little debt, tremendous cash flow. You know, the way it\u2019s supposed to be. And it\u2019s great. And the reason I tell you that is because that is the kind of thinking we need now in the United States. We need that kind of thinking. We need that \u2013 whatever it is. We need a mentality that\u2019s going to \u2013 you know, we\u2019re at $19 trillion in debt. It\u2019s going to be up to $21 trillion. You saw that horrible budget. Horrible, horrible budget that was approved two weeks ago and that\u2019s going to lift it. And so we went along and a lot of things have happened and then the polls came out which I love and new ones came out today and I\u2019ll tell you right now. You know, now that we\u2019re at it. And they came out some brand new ones \u2013 some beauties. And one\u2019s coming out \u2013 I guess a big one\u2019s coming out. I don\u2019t know exactly what it is but it\u2019s got to be pretty good because I see the response. I mean, even this with all the people still trying to come into this building. Somebody said it\u2019s a barn. This is a very nice barn actually. But with all of the people still trying to come in, you see what it is. And we do have something special in a couple of minutes. To me, it\u2019s really special because it\u2019s a person that I think is a spectacular person. So it\u2019s very special to me. But then the polls came out and some of them \u2013 as an example \u2013 national polls 38% for Trump, 20% for second. I wouldn\u2019t even names. Right? I won\u2019t even mention names. I\u2019m going to be non-confrontational today for a change. 21% for the second. 11%. And then they\u2019re all down. Some of them are actually at 0% and 1%. I don\u2019t know. Jeb \u2013 well, you know, Jeb\u2019s got one problem. He loves Common Core, meaning he wants your kids educated from Washington, which is immediately no good. And his second problem is he\u2019s very weak on illegal immigration. Remember, he said they come as an act of love. I said, \u201cWhat? They come as an act of love?\u201d So I think those are two very bad points frankly. ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in Ames, Iowa \u2013 Part 2"}, {"text": "Part 1 of 6.

With the snow coming down and it\u2019s a little cold outside and you have hundreds of people still outside trying to get in. But you know, we won\u2019t wait. We\u2019ll go ahead. Right? We\u2019ll go ahead. First of all, congratulations to the Iowa State basketball team. You had a \u2013 what was that all about? I turned on the game. I said, \u201cWow, this shouldn\u2019t be that good of a game.\u201d And at the end of the game, I said, \u201cWho won?\u201d Yes? That was great and it\u2019s a great achievement. I also want to pay my respects to Ben Carson. They had a really bad accident. Some of his staffers were hurt really bad. So I just want to pay my respects to Ben. He\u2019s a good guy \u2013 a really good guy \u2013 and his staffers and hopefully they get better. Say a prayer for them. Okay? We\u2019ve had an amazing time today. We\u2019ve been all over Iowa and we\u2019re going to be here tomorrow. We\u2019re going to be here so much you\u2019re going to get so sick of me. You\u2019re going to say, \u201cPlease, tell him to get out of here. Tell him to leave. Tell him to go.\u201d But we\u2019ve had an incredible time. And you know it started really \u2013 we\u2019ve had really a pretty good week. The debate last week \u2013 everybody watched the debate. And who knew about these debates? I didn\u2019t know anything about the debates. And it\u2019s been fun and it\u2019s been interesting. And I\u2019ve been treated semi-fairly by the moderators. Not 100%. Some have been very fair actually, and some have been not so fair. And you know, a lot of the press hasn\u2019t been very fair. Boy, look at the press back there. They must think there\u2019s a big event going happen today. Wow, that\u2019s a lot of them \u2013 it\u2019s like the Academy Awards. But we\u2019ve had an amazing \u2013 it\u2019s been an amazing experience and it started really on June 16th when we came down the escalator. We came down that escalator and it was \u2013 I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d to my wife, who\u2019s been so supportive and so wonderful. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re going to make America great again. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d And you know, it\u2019s hard to do this because when you think of it I\u2019ve never done it before. I\u2019ve never been a politician. Thank goodness but I\u2019ve never been a politician. I\u2019ve always done jobs and put a lot of people to work. Tens of thousands of people over the years. And you know, I have thousands of Hispanics that love me. The Nevada poll just came out where I\u2019m leading with Hispanics, which I knew, I knew. And we came out at that particular opening when I opened and said I\u2019m going to run for president I gave up a lot. You know, gave up a lot of different things including telling our friends at NBC no more Apprentice. That\u2019s hard to do. You have a top show and you say, \u201cI\u2019m not doing it anymore. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d They wanted to do it so badly. And Steve Burke, who\u2019s a fantastic executive, came up to my office and said \u201cCome on, Donald. Come on. Do it. You\u2019re not going to run. Do it. Do it.\u201d I said, \u201cSteve, I\u2019m going to run.\u201d I was pretty sure. You know, that was about two months before. I was pretty sure. It really is a tough thing to do. You know, all my life I\u2019ve heard \u201cIf you\u2019re a very successful person, you\u2019ll never run for president. You\u2019ll never really run for politics. But you\u2019ll never ever run for president.\u201d And I built a great company and it\u2019s a tremendous number. You saw the filings. The press was going to look so closely. It was like D-Day when we put those papers in. You know, first thing I did I announced. They said, \u201cOh, he\u2019s actually going to do it\u201d because most of them said \u201cHe\u2019ll never do it.\u201d Then when I signed\u2026that\u2019s when you sign your life away.

And in the meantime in Michigan and other places, we have plants closing all over the place. And they\u2019re spending \u2013 think about it $2.5 billion. Then they\u2019re going to sell cars, trucks, and parts into the United States. No tax, no nothing? I\u2019ll say you\u2019re going to have to pay a tax folks and you know what? Ford will say if I have to pay a tax, we\u2019re going to stay in the United States. I mean, it\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s very simple.

By the way, think of the Iran deal for one second. I always said and this came to me two weeks ago. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of it sooner. Very disappointed with myself. The Iran deal is the worst deal I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated. Okay? I\u2019m wrong. You know what the worse deal is? Iran is a part of that one too. We gave them Iraq. That\u2019s even better. Think of it. We gave Iran Iraq. Iran has the biggest \u2013 think of it. They\u2019re going to have the richest. If you go to Iraq, take a look. Among the largest oil reserves in the world. We gave them by decapitating Iraq and then leaving. Because frankly once we did it, we should have kept 20,000 troops. We give Iraq. So not only did they make a great deal in terms of the Iran deal that we know having to do with nuclear, we also gave them Iraq. We gave them Iraq that they\u2019ve been after for 100 years. We handed it to them. So now, they have the largest oil reserves in the world. That\u2019s even better than the original deal. I mean, whoever is representing Iran is doing a hell of a job. Okay? If that was a stock, you\u2019ve got to buy some. So, we are not going to have deals like that with me. It\u2019s not going to happen. We\u2019re going to become rich again. We\u2019re going to become safe again. And we\u2019re going to become strong again. And you\u2019re going to remember this. It\u2019s going to be an important moment for all of us.

We\u2019re going to New Hampshire. Then we go to the finals. Three weeks. We\u2019ve got four weeks to go and then we have three weeks after we start.

And people in the area knew that they had bombs \u2013 who the hell doesn\u2019t know your next door neighbor and they didn\u2019t want to talk about it. You\u2019ve got to report these people. We\u2019ve got a real problem. You\u2019ve got to report them. No more nonsense. They didn\u2019t report them. And the reason they didn\u2019t is because they don\u2019t disagree with them so much. Okay? Believe me. It\u2019s not because they\u2019re afraid. You saw the one that wasn\u2019t politically correct to report them. They didn\u2019t want to report them. I mean, give me a break. So we have to change. So it started off with me where I was going to talk about trade. I was talk about all of the things. I was going to talk about the military and building it up. I was going to do all of this. But after Paris and California and there\u2019ll be others because they have no fear of us. But after Paris and California, I\u2019ve totally changed and my poll numbers went up 10 points. It\u2019s amazing. It went up 10 points. I said, \u201cWhat you think it was the debates?\u201d Because I did good in the debates. They said \u201cNo, people view you as a tough cookie that\u2019s not going to take this crap.\u201d That\u2019s what it is. And now I talk about protection. I talk about \u2013 trust me. The trade. Oh, that\u2019s so easy for me. I\u2019ve got the greatest guys in the world. They\u2019re going to come and they\u2019re going to do a great job. I\u2019m going to do some myself.

It\u2019s wonderful\u2026If we don\u2019t win, to me, and honestly you should feel the same thing, if we don\u2019t win it\u2019s a total waste of time because you have somebody else in there, they won\u2019t be able to do what I do. They\u2019re not going to be able to \u2013 and even if you get one of these Republicans in\u2026 Like the wall. When I say Mexico is going to pay, they all laughed. They all go \u201cHehehe.\u201d They think it\u2019s funny. Honestly. These are people. They think it\u2019s funny. They\u2019re laughing. You know, lightly like \u201cOh ho, that\u2019s so funny. Hahaha.\u201d They need to pay for the walls, folks. They\u2019re making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with Mexico. The wall is peanuts. They\u2019ve got to pay for the wall. \u2026And then the other day\u2026it was Ted Cruz, who\u2019s a nice guy, but he said \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall at the southern border.\u201d I said, \u201cWhoa.\u201d And my wife is sitting. \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d Right? No. Ted\u2019s a good guy. But he said\u2026I think it was on Fox. He was being interviewed and he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall at the southern border.\u201d He didn\u2019t say Mexico is going to pay. He hasn\u2019t gotten that far yet but believe me that\u2019s going to happen. See, they\u2019re all trying to catch up with me because when I did this stuff it was very out there. Now I\u2019m the one that everybody wants to sort of aspire to. But what happens is \u2013 so Ted\u2019s up and he\u2019s talking and\u2026\u201dWe\u2019re going to build a wall.\u201d My wife is sitting there and she says \u201cDarling, did you hear that? He just said they\u2019re going to build a wall. That\u2019s the first time \u2013 you know, that\u2019s what you say!\u201d She hasn\u2019t heard that from any other candidate. Okay, so we\u2019re going to build a wall. Mexico is going to pay for it. There is so many things that we\u2019re going to do. But when I started the journey, it was amazing. I came down. It took courage. I went down into the lobby of Trump Tower on the escalator with Melania. I have never seen \u2013 it looked like the Academy Awards. The press. We have a lot of press here today. All live. Look at all those live cameras. So, when I came down in the escalator, we came down and I said we\u2019re going to do things and I mentioned illegal immigration. You wouldn\u2019t even be talking about illegal \u2013 it wasn\u2019t even on the radar. Nobody was talking about illegal immigration. Is that right? Now it\u2019s one of the big subjects. And that\u2019s why and one of the beautiful polls that came out and I\u2019m so proud of it. CNN just came out with a poll a couple of weeks ago, 37% for Trump, second is 16%, third is 14%, then 12%. So they\u2019re way down. But on the economy, 55%. That\u2019s with 16 people at the time. On the budget, I mean, I understand the budget, the economy, I win it hands down. All right. But listen to this. On illegal immigration, I\u2019m almost at 50%. And on ISIS likewise almost at 50%. So, people want to be protected. They want to feel safe. They need strength. They need toughness. They need smarts. I don\u2019t want to be tough. You know, I know a lot of tough guys but they\u2019re not smart and they\u2019re the easiest. You can be tough. You\u2019ve got to be smart. Let\u2019s start smart first. You\u2019ve got to be smart, tough. You\u2019ve got to be tough. Because the world is trying to take advantage of us. So what happens is this. I came out, I started. I did it \u2013 I was, oh, that first couple of weeks with illegal immigration and Mexico and all of the stuff. Then Kate was killed in San Francisco and Jamiel was killed in Los Angeles. Jamiel Shaw \u2013 an unbelievable young man \u2013 was killed, just shot right through the head by an illegal immigrant. Kate was shot by a guy who came in five or six times, shot in the back. So many great people. These are two. So many. And then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people aren\u2019t paying taxes and all of this stuff. Right? And all of a sudden, people are coming over and I\u2019d say the wall and now they\u2019re starting to say the wall. We have to be progressive in our thinking. When I say progressive, I mean like smart. I\u2019m not talking progressive like Bernie Sanders would say. This guy wants to tax you. Think of it. Think of it. This guy wants to raise your taxes to 90%. No, no. You have to move out of this. I love this area by the way. I\u2019ve been here many times. Great golfing area. Right? We love it. No more golf if Bernie Sanders \u2013 no more golf. No, no. You won\u2019t have any golf anymore. You won\u2019t have any money left to be golfing. You\u2019ll be paying it in taxes. This guy is a total disaster.

By the way, you talk about low energy? She has lower energy than Jeb Bush, which is hard to believe. She does! And I\u2019ll tell you and I\u2019ve been saying it and maybe it\u2019s rude. Maybe it\u2019s rude. Maybe it\u2019s not. But it doesn\u2019t matter. We have a much bigger problem. We have to save our country. So if I\u2019m rude or if people think I\u2019m rude and if people think I\u2019m rude, I\u2019m actually a nice person. I have a big heart. I want to help people. I want to help the migration. I want to do a safe zone in Syria. I don\u2019t want them coming here. We don\u2019t know who these people are. They\u2019re undocumented. They\u2019re undocumented. And we should do a safe zone over there. We should have the Gulf states \u2013 Saudi Arabia \u2013 these states, they\u2019re not spending. They\u2019ve got to spend. They\u2019ve got to pay. You know, we\u2019re protecting them. They won\u2019t be there for two minutes if we\u2019re not protecting them. They\u2019ve got to start paying. They\u2019re not taking anybody. Okay? How about Germany taking millions \u2013 can you believe what she\u2019s doing to that country? And she was the person of the year and I wasn\u2019t. Everybody said Trump was supposed \u2013 what are you going to do? I think she\u2019s made a terrible mistake. We\u2019ll find out. Time will tell. They\u2019re having tremendous crime problems. I think she\u2019s made a terrible mistake. But what I like is in Syria with other people\u2019s money meaning the Gulf states and others and Germany and others because look Germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people. They\u2019ll give us the money. We\u2019d do a massive safe zone. And then eventually when this whole catastrophe straightens out, which I\u2019ll probably be able to get it straightened out. I understand that stuff. But once it\u2019s straightened out, they can go back home to their country. You know, to their area. It\u2019s interesting. I have thousands of people who work for me. Thousands. And they\u2019re people that come from far \u2013 they\u2019re all here legally. Don\u2019t worry about it. I use e-verify. But I have people \u2013 oh, they go and check. These guys go check. They went into the Old Post Office, checking everybody. \u201cAre you here illegally? Are you here illegally?\u201d They said they found one person out of hundreds of hundreds and hundreds. I don\u2019t believe it. Okay? I don\u2019t believe it. But you know, it\u2019s possible. We do have 11 million people in the country and it\u2019s probably a much higher number than that. Okay? It\u2019s probably a much higher number. But we have to do something about it and we\u2019re going to do. So I just want to finish by saying, look, we have the situation that\u2019s out of control. Our country is a dumping ground for the rest of the world. We\u2019re laughed at by the rest of the world. And when I started this journey and it\u2019s a journey and I do love you people and you\u2019re amazing people. And by the way, you\u2019re so smart. You know, a lot of times they\u2019ll say, \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s people are blue collar.\u201d I love blue collar. I\u2019m honored by that. But they\u2019re not blue collar. I mean, we have blue collar. We have executives. And we have young people. They said the audience is older. It\u2019s not older. The audience is young. The other night in Iowa, I told that and I said we have so many young people and the place erupted. They\u2019re all young people. We have an amazing thing happening. It\u2019s just \u2013 look, that\u2019s their way of marginalizing not even me. It\u2019s their way of marginalizing you. It\u2019s disgusting. But when I started this journey and it\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s a journey and it\u2019s a movement that\u2019s taking place. It\u2019s a movement. Remember the old days? Silent majority? It\u2019s not right. It\u2019s a noisy majority. People are angry. It\u2019s a noisy majority. These aren\u2019t silent people anymore. I got to people you can\u2019t even hear. This is an amazing thing that\u2019s happened. I received a call from one of the biggest reporters who happens to be liberal but that\u2019s okay. We can have a couple of them. Right? But a guy who\u2019s really respected. Recently. And he said, \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d I said \u201cHow does what feel?\u201d He said, \u201cWhat you have done has never been done in the history of politics in the United States.\u201d I mean, even CNN said number one political story of the year was Trump. You know what number two was? ISIS. ISIS was two. I\u2019d rather reverse it. Let ISIS be one, let me be two because I want to knock the hell out of them and make me number one next year. Make me number one next year. But this reporter, who\u2019s a great intellect actually and a very smart guy and very good guy. He said, \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done has never been done before in the history of this country.\u201d Newt Gingrich was on a television show the other day and said this is one of the great phenomenons I\u2019ve seen in politics. Nobody has ever seen it because crowds like this \u2013 forget it\u2026It\u2019s unbelievable what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s beautiful what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s beautiful what\u2019s happening. But Newt Gingrich said he\u2019s never seen anything like this. But he said to me, the reporter, said never been done before. I said, \u201cWell, you know, it\u2019s fine. But if I don\u2019t win, it\u2019s just a waste of time.\u201d He goes, \u201cNo, no, no. What you\u2019ve done is incredible.\u201d He said, \u201cEven if you don\u2019t win, what you\u2019ve done is incredible. You\u2019ve totally changed the landscape of politics.\u201d No, don\u2019t applaud. Don\u2019t applaud. Don\u2019t applaud. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ve totally changed the landscape of politics. It\u2019s forever going to be different.

We\u2019ve got to build a wall. So when I talk and when I\u2019m up on the stage with these guys, these people, wonderful people and a very nice woman, Carly, she\u2019s a nice woman. When I\u2019m up on the stage with them, they think I\u2019m crazy when I say Mexico. I would say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall. It\u2019s going to be a great wall. It\u2019s going to be a real wall.\u201d See this ceiling? This ceiling is peanuts compared to the height of the wall I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about if they ever get up there, they\u2019re not coming down because it\u2019s too dangerous. All right? Do you ever see what they do now? We have these little walls. They build ramps. They built a ramp. I said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cheaper just to knock the wall down?\u201d And then they drive over it with Jeeps loaded up with drugs. Did you see this? They build ramps. It was a picture in Time Magazine. It\u2019s a ramp. A little ramp that goes over the wall. So they have a Jeep over down, boom, make money. We get the drugs. \u2026You\u2019ve got to build a wall. We get the drugs. They get the cash. Not so good. Right? We don\u2019t like that deal. Our politicians don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t know. So when I say Mexico is going to pay for it. These guys on the stage. They\u2019re not business people. They don\u2019t understand. Mexico makes a fortune off the United States. Number one, we give them a lot of money. But in addition to that, they\u2019re taking our businesses. They\u2019re making \u2013 you talk about a trade deficit. I\u2019ll tell you what, Mexico in a certain way is a mini version the new China. Mexico is making an absolute fortune. Peanuts compared to the cost of the wall. Let\u2019s say the cost of the wall is $10 billion. That\u2019s a good. I think I can do a great job for $10 billion. I think we\u2019ll have a lot of money left over. \u2026And by the way, 20 years ago they wanted to build a wall. People that are opposed to it now they wanted it to stop and they wanted to build the wall. You know one of the reasons they didn\u2019t build the wall? Because of the environmental protection agency. They couldn\u2019t get an environmental impact study approved. Can you believe it? Because there was a toad, a turtle or a snake or something was in the way. Now, think of it, in China, in the South China Sea, there were these low level land masses that were covered by water but pretty close to the top. China sends in massive excavators\u2026They\u2019re building military fortresses in the South China Sea. And a friend of mine who\u2019s one of the biggest and richest people in China \u2013 he\u2019s a great guy. They\u2019re great people. They\u2019re fine. They\u2019re just too smart. I mean, their leaders are too smart for our people. They won\u2019t be too smart when I put my people there. When they call up, \u201cWe\u2019d like to speak to the donor that is negotiating.\u201d No, no, the donor now is Carl Icahn. You can just speak to Carl Icahn. You know, Carl. Great businessman. You have so many people. They call all these businesspeople call. So a friend of mine \u2013 so I call and I say, \u201cYou\u2019re actually doing that.\u201d And then jokingly, I asked, \u201cHow long did it take to get started? Did you have to get an environmental impact study approved in order to excavate?\u201d He looked at me and he goes \u201cI hope you\u2019re kidding when you say that.\u201d They conceived of the idea. They started digging four hours later. Okay? There\u2019s no \u2013 go through 25 years of environmental impact. You\u2019re going to hurt the snail. You\u2019re going to hurt this. You\u2019re going to \u2013 They\u2019re doing a big thing. They excavated massive, massive, take a look. Massive \u2013 the biggest excavator. They\u2019re ripping the hell out of that ocean. They\u2019re ripping it and they\u2019re taking that dirt and they\u2019re putting it and they\u2019re building air fields and they\u2019re building forts. We couldn\u2019t do it because just like I said for the wall. Legitimately, they couldn\u2019t get an environmental impact statement. Now, that\u2019s probably not the only reason it didn\u2019t happen. I heard their costs were too high. With me, that\u2019s easy. You know, I\u2019m doing the Old Post Office in Washington. I\u2019m under-budget. I\u2019m ahead of schedule. Hey, look at the campaign. Guys at $59 million and he\u2019s down at the bottom. I\u2019m nothing and I\u2019m at the top. It\u2019s the same thing. I actually said \u2013 it\u2019s funny. The other day, I got this great review. They said \u201cTrump is a great speaker. The crowd is spellbound. But he has one problem.\u201d I\u2019m reading. I want to see. \u201cThe problem is he speaks through the applause.\u201d In other words, I say that, you applaud, I start talking before you finish your applause. And you know why? Because I\u2019m so excited because we have so much potential. It\u2019s true. I don\u2019t want to wait for your freaking applause. We have \u2013 I have so many. We have so much potential. There\u2019s so many things to do. I don\u2019t really sort of want to wait. I want to do it. And I just noticed. You did it again. You were getting ready to get a big applause because you like that and I\u2019m speaking. I killed the applause. He\u2019s right. Except I\u2019m not a speaker; what I am is a doer.

So we have 28,000 people on the border separating South Korea from this maniac in North Korea. We get nothing. What do we get? Nothing? They\u2019re making a fortune. It\u2019s an economic behemoth. A lot that you don\u2019t know. We protect Germany. Germany. Mercedes Benz. How many people have a Mercedes Benz? We protect Germany. It\u2019s an economic behemoth. We protect Saudi Arabia. They were during the good oil days \u2013 now it\u2019s probably half, which is fine. But during the good oil days, they were making $1 billion a day. And we protect them. Our military protects them. They pay us peanuts, not like nothing. And then if we want to buy, if we want to move to another location, \u201cWell, that\u2019s very expensive if we do that.\u201d Charges us rent? I mean, look, we are run by people that are so bad. They\u2019re so out of their league. And I see it. I see it on this stage. A lot of them are nice people. You know, a lot of people think I don\u2019t like these guys. I do like them. \u2026They don\u2019t have business sense and business ability. They don\u2019t have common sense. They\u2019re politicians. They\u2019re all talk. They\u2019re no action.

In China, 2000 years ago, they built the Great Wall of China, which is bigger than any wall we\u2019re thinking about. Okay? The Great Wall of China goes 18,000 miles. We have 2,000 miles of which we really only need 1,000 miles because you have a lot of natural barriers that are extremely tough to get across. We have 1,000 miles. So China has 18,000 or 13,000 miles. And we have 1,000 miles. We have modern cranes. We have Caterpillar tractors. I want to use Caterpillar. I don\u2019t want to use Komatsu. Made in America! Even my hats are made in America. It wasn\u2019t easy to find a guy to do those hats. You know what I\u2019m talking about. I see so many knock-offs of my hat. Right? Make America Great Again. I see these things. They\u2019re out of plastic. They\u2019re out of all sorts of crap. Mine are made in America and honestly they do a great job but they don\u2019t produce as much as I\u2019d like because frankly there\u2019s a big \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s amazing. Those hats are amazing. But I wanted to have it made \u2013 and you know why I wanted to have it made \u2013 I wanted it anyway. But I also knew that as soon as the hats came out and other things \u2013 as soon as the hats came out, I knew the press would be calling. And it\u2019s true. First hour when the hats were announced, I get a call from the New York Times. \u201cMr. Trump, where were those hats made?\u201d I said, \u201cAmerica.\u201d I knew it. I knew it. Because as you know if I would have said China, I would have been in big, big trouble. But they\u2019re being knocked off all over the world. I mean, I see hats \u2013 they\u2019re like helmets. I see them all. But what are you going to do? ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Hilton Head, South Carolina \u2013 Part 8"}, {"text": "Okay?

But they still want to live. So here\u2019s Obama \u2013 gives an exact date. He gives an exact date. So they pulled back. And everyone says, \u201cOh, we\u2019re doing so well. Look, we\u2019re doing so well.\u201d The enemy \u2013 why should they fight when they know in 18 months they can go and take the place. So what happens? So we have ISIS taking a lot of the oil. I said, \u201cTake the oil.\u201d Remember, when we left \u2013 I was opposed going in because I said you\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East because you had Iraq and you had Iran. And I said, they\u2019ll fight. They\u2019re always fighting, for decades and decades, for generations. They fight. That\u2019s what they do. They fight. How we ever got involved in this mess is hard to believe. They fight. And they were equal militarily. They go this way 10 feet. They go this way 10 feet. Then they rest a couple of years. Then they start fighting again. Then Saddam Hussein throws a little gas. Everyone goes crazy. \u201cOh, he\u2019s using gas.\u201d They go back and forth. It\u2019s the same. And they were stabilized. And I said, \u201cIf you go after one or the other, in this case Iraq, you\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East. It\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what happened. We totally destabilized the Middle East. We have now migrations largely because of what\u2019s happened afterwards. You know, Iraq was horrible. It was stupid to go in. We should have never gotten in. But we shouldn\u2019t have gone out the way we went out. And we shouldn\u2019t have given dates. I mean, I would have probably said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay forever\u201d and they would have said, \u201cOh man, keep going, keep going\u201d and eventually they would get tired. They\u2019d say, \u201cThis guy\u2019s crazy. I mean, he\u2019s never going to leave\u201d and you\u2019ll make a deal. But when you\u2019re announcing you\u2019re leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said, they\u2019d just pull back and as soon as we left, they come in. Okay? So they have the oil. You know who the biggest beneficiary of the oil is? Right? China. China. Always China. I love China. I love Mexico. Their leaders are too smart for us. We have no border. We will build a wall. Mexico will pay for the wall. We\u2019re going to build a wall. We\u2019re going to have a border. And people are going to come into our country but they\u2019re going to come in through a legal process. They\u2019re not coming in the way they\u2019re coming in now. Just walking in like nothing. They\u2019re going to come in but they\u2019re going to come through a legal process. So with Iraq, so we give them a date and they take over. We didn\u2019t take the oil. So for four years, I\u2019ve been talking about it. Then because of Paris all of a sudden they started bombing the oil. But I didn\u2019t want to just bomb the oil. I want to take the oil. They\u2019re bombing. You know, we\u2019re bombing. Great. What\u2019s going to happen after that? So we\u2019re bombing. And you know, we\u2019re not really bombing it because they\u2019re still selling it. I said, \u201cHow can they keep selling it?\u201d \u201cObama doesn\u2019t want to hit him too hard because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to pollute the atmosphere.\u201d No, this is serious. Now, think of it. He talks about the carbon\u2026and yet he\u2019ll fly a very old Air Force One \u2013 an old Boeing 747 with the old engines, you know, spewing stuff.

They say, \u201cDon\u2019t use hairspray. It\u2019s bad for the ozone.\u201d So I\u2019m sitting in this concealed apartment, this concealed unit. You know, I really do live in a very nice apartment. Right? But it\u2019s sealed. It\u2019s beautiful. I don\u2019t think anything gets out and I\u2019m not supposed to be using hairspray. But think of it. So Obama is always talking about the global warming, that global warming in our biggest and most dangerous problem. Okay? No, no, think of it. I mean, even if you\u2019re a believer in global warming, ISIS is a big problem. Russia is a problem. China is a problem. We\u2019ve got a lot of problems. By the way, the maniac in North Korea is a problem. He actually has nuclear weapons. Right? That\u2019s a problem. We\u2019ve got a lot of problems. We\u2019ve got a lot of problems.

There\u2019s something going on that we don\u2019t know about. I mean, honestly. And you\u2019re almost thinking \u2013 I\u2019m not saying that and I\u2019m not a conspiracy person\u2026I\u2019m just hoping they\u2019re just stupid people. Okay? Which they are.

We\u2019re not going to have a country. We\u2019re not going to have our country. And we\u2019re like a dumping ground for the world.

One of our Jeeps, of course. A military Jeep, holding the Libyan flag, and you know, \u201cFreedom! Freedom! Freedom!\u201d and then he gets killed by the same people. So we backed people that turned out to be far worse than Gaddafi. Look at what we did in Iraq. Look at what we did in Iraq. I mean, what the hell did we get? We spent $2 trillion. And that was as of 1.5 years ago. I keep saying $2 trillion. It\u2019s a lot more than that. We spent $2 trillion. We have thousands of deaths. And I\u2019m not even talking other side.

And they get together and they do wonderful programs. They\u2019re smart people. As opposed to getting it done by bureaucrats that are getting big fat checks in Washington. I mean, we have such talent in this country and we don\u2019t use it. So Obamacare \u2013 dead. Common Core \u2013 gone. We\u2019re going to get rid of it.

And the ad is him asking the question and I\u2019m standing here like this because I haven\u2019t \u2013 in fact you see in one of them I\u2019m just about ready to open my mouth. But he doesn\u2019t let me respond. That\u2019s almost false advertising. Isn\u2019t it? So I mentioned it. Hillary is a disaster. I mean, Hillary \u2013 Hillary\u2019s controlled by her money. So is Jeb. By the way, I\u2019m the only one self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m self-funding. You know, one of the things that makes me happy, I heard one of the commentators this morning said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been watching this stuff for 50 years. I\u2019ve never seen anything like what\u2019s happened with Trump.\u201d \u2026I think low energy was a brutal statement. Right? And by the way, low energy can be applied to Hillary. I just don\u2019t like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies. Right? Because I consider them enemies. We view this as war. Don\u2019t we view this as war? It\u2019s war. It\u2019s war. So you don\u2019t like to use it. I hate to give it up\u2026 So here\u2019s the story. So we are in a situation where we have incompetent leadership, where our trade deals are killing us, our military is not prepared. Gen. Odierno when he left just recently he said we are less prepared now than at anytime that he can remember, and I think he went back to the beginning. But let\u2019s say Second World War. Okay? That\u2019s enough. Now we should be very prepared now because the world hates us. She has done a terrible job as Secretary of State. I mean, think of it. Putin comes out, he said, \u201cDonald Trump is brilliant. He\u2019s doing an amazing job and he\u2019s leading the pack.\u201d Okay. That\u2019s nice. And she and my opponents say \u201cOh, isn\u2019t that terrible that Putin said \u2013 \u201c Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we could get along with the world? Wouldn\u2019t it be? Seriously? No, no. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice? I mean, they want me to refuse his statement. \u201cHow dare you say I\u2019m brilliant.\u201d Who\u2019s going to do that? And by the way, if he said it about any one of them, they would have been very happy. But the point is we have to get along. The world has blown up around Barack Obama. Now, I don\u2019t know if you saw his recent release. They were talking about the Department of State. State Department. And they said very strongly, you know, the things that they\u2019ve done. Well, they couldn\u2019t find it because what have they done that\u2019s good? And they said bringing peace to Syria. Did you see that? So instead of saying they made a mistake, call it a typo, they made a mistake, they\u2019re trying to justify it. \u201cWell, we meant we\u2019re working on it.\u201d Can you believe? Bringing peace to Syria. The world is blowing up. The migration in Syria. They say one of their achievements of the year is bringing peace to Syria. And the whole world is talking about it. It\u2019s the level of stupidity is incredible. I\u2019m telling you. I used to use the word incompetent. Now, I just call them stupid. I went to an Ivy League school. I\u2019m very highly educated. I know words. I have the best words. I have the \u2013 but there\u2019s no better word than stupid. Right? There is none. There is none. There\u2019s no word like that. So, we are going to turn things around. But if we have Hillary, I\u2019ve got to tell you, I just saw where for the last week she\u2019s been hitting me really hard with the women card. Okay? Really hard. And I had to say, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough. That\u2019s enough.\u201d And we did a strong number. She\u2019s not going to win.

You know what $500 billion is? You do hundred dollar bills and you fill the room to the ceiling. $500 billion deficit \u2013 trade deficit with China. What are we? I guess the answer is certainly let\u2019s not blame us. Our leaders are stupid and/or\u2026they have deals. Because what\u2019s happened is all of this money is being given to them by special interests, by all of these people including lobbyists. And these lobbyists make our leaders do \u2013 our leaders \u2013 can you believe this our leaders? But they make the leaders of our country do things that they don\u2019t even want to do because they\u2019ve given them tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars. When I look at this guy Jeb Bush, he spent $59 million on his campaign and he\u2019s down in the grave. He\u2019s nowhere. No, no, think of it. It\u2019s got to be much more than that. It was actually $59 million a while ago. Every time I turn on an ad, I see an ad about Trump. I mean, it\u2019s not that bad an ad either. It\u2019s like \u2013 we\u2019ve got to do an ad, do an ad. Look, he\u2019s a low energy person. Let\u2019s face it. We don\u2019t need low energy. We need lots of energy. But he\u2019s spent \u2013 think of it, think of it \u2013 he\u2019s spent $59 million. I spent nothing. Right? Nothing. Now, I\u2019m going to be spending. You probably saw it. We\u2019re going to start spending a lot of money because I don\u2019t want to take any chances\u2026I love getting up and for the last couple of months, I\u2019ve been leading from practically the time I announced. Right? And for the last \u2013 and leading a lot. I\u2019m going to go over that because I go over polls. I love polls. I love polls. Now when \u2013 if they turn negative, I don\u2019t like them. And I promise if they turn negative, I\u2019m not going to be talking about them. In fact, I get criticized all the time. \u201cYou\u2019re always talking about your polls.\u201d One of these guys has got 2%. He\u2019s at 2%. I\u2019m at 42%. And one of these guys who\u2019s at 2% said \u201cHe always talks about his polls, and I don\u2019t.\u201d And I wouldn\u2019t either if I have 2%. I swear I wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t do it at all. But you know, I love to tell the story where I\u2019ve spent nothing and Bush has spent $59 million but much higher than that. That\u2019s just. You know, because I see since them. You can\u2019t turn on this television without these commercials on Fox. Every two minutes it\u2019s a commercial on Trump. You know what he did? It\u2019s false advertising. So I killed him in the debate. According to Reuters, according to everybody, Drudge, who\u2019s an amazing guy by the way, if you don\u2019t know Drudge \u2013 Matt Drudge \u2013 right? He\u2019s a great guy. But Drudge \u2013 46%. 46%, you have 15 people. Now, you noticed a couple of them have dropped out\u2026But 15, 16 people \u2013 46%. Time Magazine \u2013 49%. Think of it. Slate \u2013 51%. U.S. News and World Report \u2013 69% said I won the debate\u2026PBS \u2013 Public Broadcasting System \u2013 69% said Trump won. You know, it\u2019s amazing. We have Washington Times said 62%. CBS \u2013 59%. Fox \u2013 62%. Fox Las Vegas \u2013 62%. So they all say \u2013 and I go back home. After that, I like to see how did I do. Did I look good? Looking good is very important. Right? Sometimes it\u2019s not as much like what you say it\u2019s how you look. I look good. Didn\u2019t sound too good. But that\u2019s okay\u2026 But I go home and I watch and the pundits will say \u2013 I mean, they can\u2019t totally kill me because I know what\u2019s happening, we know what\u2019s happening. \u201cWell, Mr. Trump was okay tonight.\u201d I won every, every single online poll. I won. And then here\u2019s Bush. So Bush does an ad and he takes me and he was talking about, you know, something and he made a statement then I killed him\u2026By the way, I\u2019m at 69%. He\u2019s at 1%. He got, he came in last. He takes the ad and I shouldn\u2019t even talk about him. He\u2019s down to two or three but it bothers me when I see a guy spending, you know, $60 million on ads against me a lot of it. Right? I said, \u201cWhy is he doing this? Doesn\u2019t he have something better? He should go home, just relax.\u201d No, honestly, he should go home and relax. He shouldn\u2019t be wasting his time. But it does. I said, \u201cWhy is this guy spending all this money?\u201d Now he\u2019s spending it actually against a couple of other guys. They were also very weak\u2026But here\u2019s my ad. So he made a statement and after that his spin people said \u201cOh, he was great. He took on Trump.\u201d He took on Trump? I\u2019m standing here. He\u2019s over there. Took on Trump. He made a statement that was written by his pollster. You know? He said, \u201cMr. Trump, why don\u2019t you this \u2013 \u201c I said okay. Then I gave him an answer. I said, \u201cJeb, I\u2019m at 42%. You\u2019re at 2%.\u201d Right? It\u2019s a simple answer.

This is a movement. No matter where we go it\u2019s amazing. We go to Dallas. We go to Oklahoma. We go all over. We went to the other night Iowa \u2013 packed. Every place. New Hampshire. Packed. Every place we go to it\u2019s like this. It\u2019s amazing and just great, great people. And they actually had to tell over 3,000 people \u201cGo home. We\u2019ll come back.

You know it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people and they\u2019re standing; they\u2019re not sitting. So that\u2019s great. We love setting records. We want the country to set records. Right? So you know, I do this and I love to do it and I talk about our success because that\u2019s ultimately what it\u2019s all about.

Me. Nobody respects women more than Donald Trump. That I can tell you. And you know, when she said that I had no choice because I didn\u2019t start it. I had no choice and I did have to mention her husband\u2019s situation. Okay? And that is now the biggest story on television by a factor of 10. So we have to do it. You can\u2019t let people push you around. You can\u2019t let people tell lies. You can\u2019t do it. You know, it\u2019s interesting. One of the polls came out from CNBC and they said that if it\u2019s Trump against Hillary in the election, it will be the greatest voter turnout in the history of this country. I can see that. I can see it. And they said all of these people that are going to come in new \u2013 that never vote \u2013 they never vote, they don\u2019t care. They\u2019re going to mostly \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what, they\u2019re going to vote for Trump.

And they\u2019re fed up with those guys back there \u2013 the media. They are the worst. They are the worst. No, no, no, they\u2019re fed up. They\u2019re fed up with the media. \u2026And you know not all bad but there\u2019s so much dishonesty in the media, and I like to call it out. And one of the things that\u2019s really been amazing to me and it\u2019s been such \u2013 it\u2019s been so beautiful to watch \u2013 the level of genius in the public. They get it. You know? They really get it. They want to marginalize us. They want to do all of this. And they want to make everybody look like \u201cOh, gee\u201d. The level of genius. They fully understand. They know they\u2019re crooked. They know they\u2019re dishonest. And they really \u2013 otherwise, who gets worse publicity than me? And yet I see a poll at 42%. And you\u2019re talking about 15, 16 people \u2013 started with 17\u2026And you know, I\u2019d be happy with 42% if we had three. Okay? Not thrilled. I\u2019d like to be over that 50% mark but I think we\u2019re doing really well. And you know it\u2019s interesting \u2013 but the debates \u2013 okay? \u2026I love you\u2026You know, the rooms \u2013 no matter where, whether it\u2019s stadiums or big ballrooms like this one. It\u2019s amazing. And there\u2019s love in the room. \u2026The other night, I said \u2013 a friend of mine \u2013 a very, very successful guy who I would love to have negotiating against China. That\u2019s what we need. Not these hacks that we have. You know, I have guys \u2013 Carl Icahn endorsed me. Great businessman. I have great, great business people that want to be involved.

First, what they saw in Paris. Now, what they have seen in San Bernardino. And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make them think there are easy answers to very complex questions. So what I would say is number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face. We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it\u2019s suspicious, reporting what you hear, making sure that Muslim Americans don\u2019t feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help. You know, I was a Senator from New York after 9/11 and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks. One of the best things that was done \u2013 and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit \u2013 was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say we\u2019re in this together. You are not our adversary. You are our partner. And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don\u2019t fall on receptive ears. He is becoming ISIS\u2019s best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.

We get this horrible, terrible traitor and they get five killers that they\u2019ve wanted for nine years \u2013 the worst killers \u2013 and they\u2019re all back on the battlefield. You know, so many decisions. The Iran deal. The Iran deal. How bad is that? They self-inspect. \u201cOkay, good. We\u2019re not building. We promise we\u2019re not building nuclear weapons.\u201d \u201cOh, okay. That\u2019s okay.\u201d And we give them $150 billion and we don\u2019t even get our prisoners back. The whole thing is crazy. So I saw this. And I said to my wife, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll do well or not. Who the hell knows?\u201d And it\u2019s a risky thing. And I\u2019ve always heard if you\u2019re a very successful person you can\u2019t run for office, especially for president, and I see it all the time. And the people go after me. I don\u2019t even care at this point. I said, \u201cI have to do it. Now, we\u2019re going to have to do it.\u201d And I look at it last time with Romney and I didn\u2019t do it and I probably should have because he let us down. I mean, look, he let us down. That was an election \u2013 we had a failed president. Four years ago he was a failed president, just as bad as he is now. It\u2019s true. And Romney let us down. That last month \u2013 it was like he wasn\u2019t even campaigning. I said, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you on Jay Leno? Why aren\u2019t you on David Letterman? Why aren\u2019t you doing it?\u201d And he just didn\u2019t do it. So he lost the election. So I backed McCain, he lost. I backed Romney, he lost. This time I said I\u2019m doing it myself, okay? We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win. But there is an establishment out there. It\u2019s a real establishment. Real people. And they\u2019re people that are used to having their little puppets all over the place. And they\u2019re people that are used to giving donations and having control. And they\u2019re people that, you know, look when they call me I\u2019ll treat them with respect but I\u2019m not going to be doing bad things if it\u2019s bad for the country. I\u2019m not going to let Ford build a plant in Mexico if I can keep it in Michigan. And I\u2019m not going to let the car companies and Nabisco and all these people and all these companies \u2013 I\u2019m all for free trade. I think it\u2019s great. I\u2019m for it. But it\u2019s got to be smart trade. I\u2019m not going to let them move to Mexico and then sell stuff over the border with no tax, no nothing so we lose our jobs, we lose our factories, they go over here, they make it, we let them come through. How does that help us, folks? I went to the best business school in the world. Believe me, it doesn\u2019t help us. Okay? Trust me. And we\u2019re not going to make deals like that anymore. We can\u2019t. We owe $19 trillion. We can\u2019t. So the establishment is not ever probably \u2013 look, you know what? In the end, if this country starts humming even the establishment they\u2019ll be saying \u201cOkay, it\u2019s a good thing\u201d because they\u2019ll be beneficiaries also. But we do have a real establishment and they\u2019ve never seen this happen before. A writer called up and he said recently \u2013 I told this story. I mean, one of the top journalists to my way of thinking certainly in the country and beyond. And he said, \u201cMr. Trump, how does it feel?\u201d I said, \u201cHow does what feel?\u201d \u201cHow does it feel? What you\u2019ve done has never, ever been done before?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve dominated the Summer of Trump.\u201d Now they call it the Autumn of Trump. Hopefully, they\u2019re going to call it the Spring of Trump and I want the next Autumn of Trump. But I said to the writer, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I haven\u2019t done anything \u2018cause frankly if I don\u2019t win I consider this to be a total waste of time.\u201d I\u2019ll be honest with you. As much as I like being with you tonight. Because we won\u2019t be able to do anything. He said, \u201cNo, no. You\u2019ve won even if you don\u2019t win. You\u2019ve won already.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong. If I don\u2019t win, I have wasted my time.\u201d So you know, the point is that the establishment can\u2019t believe it because they\u2019ve never seen it happen before. \u2026I was on the cover of Time Magazine four or five weeks ago and Time Magazine was going to pick the Person of the Year. Everybody \u2013 even my enemies \u2013 said \u201cTrump is going to win.\u201d I said, \u201cI won\u2019t win.\u201d They said, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t win. Just like I should have gotten the Emmy for The Apprentice for the first three years. I was nominated. I should have.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019ll never win.\u201d I told everybody I\u2019ll never win because I\u2019m not Hollywood establishment. And with Time Magazine, I said \u2013 Bill O\u2019Reilly, who\u2019s a great guy, did an editorial at the end of his show two days ago saying nobody has done more than Trump, he should have won. Now, I\u2019m not saying I should have \u2013 yeah, I probably should have in all fairness \u2013 but he said \u201cNobody\u2019s done more\u201d \u2013 you know, taking over \u2013 what we\u2019ve done has been amazing \u2013 all of us together not just me. It\u2019s all of us. It\u2019s all of us. From Dallas and Mobile and Oklahoma. All of us. Because the spirit. \u2026Well, Merkel got it. Now, Merkel, what did she do? She\u2019s destroyed \u2013 I mean, she\u2019s in the process of destroying Germany with the migration. We have to help the people with the migration. We have to create a safe zone some place in Syria. But I don\u2019t want them coming into this country. I don\u2019t want them because we don\u2019t know who they are. We don\u2019t know who they are. Them with their printing press that now do the forged passports. Okay? You heard about that. So we don\u2019t know. The bottom line on that \u2013 it\u2019s such an interesting question. You\u2019ll know in about a month or two whether or not the establishment has treated me fairly. But the only thing I can say is this: If I win Iowa, I think it\u2019s over. I said before. Because I think if I win Iowa, New Hampshire is amazing. People are amazing. You would love the people. They would love you. You\u2019d love everybody. The whole country is in love\u2026I call it the noisy majority. It\u2019s no longer a silent majority. It\u2019s the noisy majority. But if we win like I think we\u2019re going to win because we have such a big league, honestly, it\u2019s not going to matter. They can\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t care about the establishment. They can\u2019t do anything. You know, the only way they can do is if I\u2019m a little bit short, if I\u2019m two votes short I have a problem because I\u2019ll have to go into that convention, I\u2019m dealing with all these blood sucker politicians and they\u2019ll make their deals and they\u2019ll have all their money guys around and they\u2019ll be in the backroom making deals. But if I get the number of delegates, there\u2019s not a thing they can do. And I\u2019ll end up doing fine with the establishment\u2026 ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Des Moines, Iowa \u2013 Part 11"}, {"text": "Question on renewable fuel: And I\u2019m not.

He said \u201cDonald Trump is\u201d \u2013 I think he used the word \u2013 \u201cterrific\u201d. That\u2019s a nice word. I mean, whoever hears that? I can tell you other candidates are not exactly saying that about me. Right? Question on campaign finance: But then I got to be, you know, started going around and I see the corruption with these Super PACs, with the stuff towards money. People that put the money in are dealing with the candidates. The whole thing is wrong. And I see it. I mean, Bush has $125 million. Think of it. $125 million. By the way, if he had $2 billion it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. Okay? But Bush has $125 million. And honestly, he\u2019s a nice person. He is. I don\u2019t want to do that but he\u2019s a very nice person. But it\u2019s $125 million. And you\u2019d say to yourself, \u201cPeople give $2 million, $5 million, $7 million. You know what\u2019s happening.\u201d But some of the Super PACs are running campaigns. They\u2019re actually running the campaign. Another thing and it\u2019s sort of interesting, one of the Super PACs I believe has $6 million. Of the $6 million \u2013 this was reported on the front page of the Los Angeles Times \u2013 one of the candidates who\u2019s a nice person so I\u2019m not going to mention the name. You know, when I like people I like them. I\u2019m a very loyal person. Of the $6 million after all of the bloodsuckers took their cuts, the fundraisers \u2013 can you believe this? \u2013 they had $140,000 left for the campaign. That\u2019s better than being a real estate broker. I\u2019d rather do that than sell houses. $140,000 left. That was in the newspaper. I don\u2019t know. I think I believe it. But I\u2019ve seen it. I saw it with the Romney campaign. Guys made tens of millions of dollars raising money for Romney. I said what the hell is this? I mean, you give money and they get a cut. Look, our laws are so corrupt. Our campaign finance laws are so totally corrupt. It\u2019s so horrible. So horrible. And I don\u2019t necessarily want to stop people from giving because I think that\u2019s a good thing but you have to get away from these PACs. What you have to have is people have to know who it is. So you have to open up the process. Let people know. If somebody wants to give $1 million, you give $1 million but everybody has to know that so and so gave $1 million because that puts a little pressure on guys like Brad who raises hundreds of millions. Puts a little pressure. But the concept of the PAC is no good. It\u2019s no good. It\u2019s a very dangerous, terrible thing. So we will change our laws because you really have no choice. It\u2019s so out of control. It\u2019s so terrible. But the papers that are in this room tonight, they should look at this. There\u2019s so little money left over for the candidates, it\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m so happy I\u2019m doing my own. We actually sent legal letters to either nine or 11 PACs. The Trump PAC, the Trump PAC, the this PAC. First of all, I\u2019m sure that out of some of them they stole the money. Some guy has no money. He sets up a Trump something PAC. Nothing to do with me. Sets it up. All of a sudden he\u2019s got $2 million sitting there. Right? People send in money. And that guy has no money. How much of that money do you think he\u2019s going to use to do what he\u2019s supposed to be doing? That\u2019s common sense. So maybe all of it but I doubt it. So we sent legal notices to every one that we could find. We don\u2019t want their money. We said \u201cDon\u2019t do it. We don\u2019t want it. And we want ideally to give the money back to the people that gave it to you.\u201d But the Super PAC concept is corrupt. It\u2019s terrible and it should be ended. And we\u2019re going to go to new campaign finance laws that are going to be terrific. Okay? Thank you.

So you know there\u2019s tremendous pressure to get rid of the guns, get rid of the magazines, no bullets. How about the one where they have three bullets in every magazine? \u2026So the people will put three bullets in. I don\u2019t think the bad guys are going to say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to break the law. I\u2019m going to go kill people today but I\u2019m going to put three bullets in.\u201d Right? These people \u2013 and you know I have arguments with them all the time and I\u2019m a practical guy. Honestly, if I didn\u2019t believe this, I couldn\u2019t say it. So in France or in California, I have a permission to carry, which is a big thing in New York. It\u2019s very hard to get. I have a license to carry. But in France or in California or in all these places where we see the shooters, right, if instead of having like in France hundreds of people in that room \u2013 Paris has the toughest gun laws in the world. France has the toughest gun laws in the world. Nobody has guns. Except the bad guys. So they walk in with the worst, the toughest, the best weaponry you could have and they said, \u201cOver here \u2013 boom. Over here \u2013 boom.\u201d So they killed 128 but many more are dying right now. They\u2019re in terrible shape in the hospitals. They just wipe the place out and they could\u2019ve stayed there for longer. They wiped it out. Then you had those two sleaze bags from California. The married couple. I saw the press \u2013 \u201cThe young married couple that did the shooting\u201d. They\u2019re not a young married couple. They\u2019re the worst. They\u2019re sleaze. \u2026They say \u201cThe young married couple\u201d. That\u2019s no young married couple. So they walk into a place and they killed 14 people and others are going to be dying probably because of a lot of other wounded people. But if somebody had guns in there \u2013 nobody had a gun\u2026How would you have done if you had a gun? Would you have been firing back a little bit? They\u2019d been in trouble. Right? They would have been in trouble. Believe me. That guy. So, you know, I went to like an Ivy League college and I have a lot of friends that are against guns and I argue with them. I talk to them. I said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re in Paris. You have all these places and there\u2019s hundreds of people. Guys walk in with guns and you have no gun. Don\u2019t you think they would\u2019ve been better if they had?\u201d They can\u2019t \u2013 they lose the argument but they never change their mind. So we have to fight for the Second Amendment.

And believe me, believe me, they want to take those guns away and you always know that the bad ones are going to have the guns and they\u2019re going to have them more so than ever before.

Do you ever notice? \u2026And by the way, Merry Christmas everybody. Merry Christmas. And happy holiday. Frankly, I have a lot of friends that aren\u2019t Christian. They like Christmas. Everybody likes Christmas. It\u2019s politically incorrect to say Merry Christmas. But when I\u2019m president, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, enjoy yourselves, don\u2019t eat too much turkey.

You know, they wanted to build a wall here 20 years ago. You know they couldn\u2019t get environmental impact statements. That\u2019s just shows you. China is building in the South China Sea massive military bases. Right? Why? They\u2019re not supposed to. They have no respect for Obama or our country. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing that.

They put the biggest escavators, not Caterpillars. I think they\u2019re using Komatsu from Japan\u2026They have these massive escavators, and I said to a friend of mine who\u2019s Chinese from China \u2013 very rich guy, very successful guy, paid me a fortune for an apartment so I happen to like him, okay? \u2013 I said jokingly \u201cHow long did it take them to do these massive islands they\u2019re building right out of the sea? Boom, those shovels go in, take out everything. How long did it take you to get the environmental impact statements?\u201d He laughed. He said, \u201cWhat are you kidding me? Nothing.\u201d They say \u201cWe will build there.\u201d About two seconds later, you have escavators digging. So we had a problem with environmental \u2013 look, I\u2019ve won many environmental awards. I\u2019m a big believer especially in clean air and clean water. I\u2019m a big believer. Just so you know. Big. And I\u2019ve gotten so many awards for the environment. So I understand the environment; I\u2019ve won many, many awards. But when you look at how we\u2019re impinged and hurt. But the wall was stopped because they couldn\u2019t get an environmental impact statement among other things. They couldn\u2019t get an environmental impact statement. Now, there was probably a snail or a turtle or a snake or something. You were ruining the habitat of a rattlesnake. I don\u2019t know. But they actually had people \u2013 a lot of people \u2013 people that now would be against it but they wanted to build a wall and years ago they couldn\u2019t get it done. \u2026You know, I said bomb the oil, right? I\u2019ve been saying that for three years. Now finally they started \u2013 after Paris they started bombing the oil. I\u2019ve been saying it for years. You know one of the reasons we didn\u2019t bomb the oil? Obama didn\u2019t want to hurt the environment. Now, I heard that and I thought somebody was kidding. I thought a comedian was saying it. It turned out to be true. He didn\u2019t want the flames and everything going into the atmosphere. This is the way we fight today. I\u2019m telling you, folks, we\u2019re being led by stupid people. We\u2019re being led by stupid people. I\u2019ve been saying not really bomb \u2013 I\u2019ve been saying take the oil. I didn\u2019t want to go into Iraq. But once we were there, I said \u201cLook, we shouldn\u2019t have been there. But then when we left, we left the wrong way.\u201d First of all, we have a president who told them a date. \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave on such and such a date.\u201d What was it like 18 months later? So the enemy all of sudden said, \u201cWow\u201d, \u2018cause don\u2019t believe it. They don\u2019t want to be killed. Okay? They don\u2019t want to be killed. So the enemy said \u201cThey\u2019re going to leave on a certain date?\u201d So they pulled back, the date comes, and now you see what happened. It\u2019s a disaster and Iran is taking over Iraq. So anyway, I couldn\u2019t believe it when they said that. When we said to our 50 soldiers two weeks ago and our president gets up and announces \u201cWe are sending 50 soldiers.\u201d Okay, first of all, he thinks it\u2019s a good press announcement. It\u2019s not. 50 soldiers \u2013 that\u2019s not a lot even though they\u2019re the elite. But those 50 soldiers because of that announcement have a target on their heart. They have a target on their heart. Why does he have to say that for? Why can\u2019t he let 50 soldiers go there quietly, stealth, stealth? Why can\u2019t he just do that? Why can\u2019t he do that? Those 50 soldiers are in grave danger today because of that, and they probably don\u2019t even know that but everybody is looking for them and that\u2019s the way it is. We have people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. We used to have General MacArthur \u2013 Douglas MacArthur \u2013 General George Patton. I mean, these were real people. These were real people. Today, we have generals that go on talk shows\u2026I saw a general the other day on a talk show. He said \u2013 and this was serious and he\u2019s a good man. They\u2019re good men. But you\u2019ve got to lead these men. Even the generals have to have some power over them. He said, \u201cWe are in the worst shape in terms of preparedness that we\u2019ve been in in decades.\u201d And this is the time when we have to be in the best shape because the world wants to kill us. And he said we are in the worst shape we\u2019ve been in many, many decades. Now, number one, he shouldn\u2019t be saying that because you\u2019re telling the enemy that and the enemy feels embolden when they hear that. Right? We shouldn\u2019t be saying it. We shouldn\u2019t be saying it. I mean, even if it\u2019s true, you don\u2019t say it. You get it fixed and you do the opposite. One thing I\u2019m going to do I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019m going to build our military so big and so strong and so powerful \u2013 so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us.

Now, perhaps \u2013 perhaps \u2013 somebody, you know, we have to have a fair Justice Department and perhaps\u2026we\u2019ll have some really good Attorney General that\u2019s going to say \u201cWell, you know\u201d. Look, we want to be fair to everybody. Okay? Including Hillary Clinton. But she committed a crime in my opinion. Now, she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. She\u2019s being protected absolutely. I have little doubt that they\u2019re going to find anything. But they\u2019ve already found it. I mean, you watch television. You have all these big scholars, these lawyers, \u201cYes, she violated section so and so\u201d. Just one after another. I mean, actually violated many, many laws, not just like a little one here. Many laws. You mentioned General Petraeus. His life was destroyed over 5% of what Hillary Clinton did. Over nothing. So I think she\u2019s going to be their nominee definitely. The only question is whether or not she\u2019ll be allowed to run. She\u2019s being protected by the Democrats. She\u2019s being protected by the President. And that\u2019s why \u2013 why do you think she\u2019s going along with these insane policies of his? Okay? I mean, she goes along with everything. I don\u2019t even \u2013 honestly in all fairness to her, I don\u2019t think she believes it. But I think she\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to say, \u201cListen, I don\u2019t like her anymore. Go take care of her. I\u2019m going to get somebody else.\u201d I\u2019m telling you. So, the question is statute of limitations. It\u2019s a five year statute of limitations. She\u2019s got a problem. She\u2019s got a problem. In one way, she\u2019s running for her life because I know one thing, if she wins that\u2019s the end of that. Right? But if she loses she could have a very serious problem.

We\u2019re going to take jobs back from all these countries that are ripping us off. We\u2019re going to become a wealthy country again. And we\u2019re going to be able to save your Social Security. \u2026I can\u2019t believe this number but I read it over \u2013 who is the man that told me the number \u2013 over 6 million people \u2013 I can\u2019t believe it \u2013 are aged 112 and over are getting Social Security\u2026But I heard it. I read it. A tremendous \u2013 like 6 million people are getting Social Security. They\u2019re dead. Meaning somebody else is picking up\u2026 \u2026The press is going to have to check it because what do I know? But can you imagine, we have 6 million \u2013 now, we know there\u2019s not 6 million, there may be one. But there\u2019s not 6 million. Anybody in this room 112 or over? Because if they are, I want to shake your hand. But \u2013 so 6 million over 112 years old picking up Social Security and that\u2019s the beginning. So there\u2019s tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. What we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to save Medicare. We\u2019re going to save Social Security. We\u2019re not going to raise the age or we\u2019re not going to do all the things that everyone else is talking about doing. They\u2019re all talking about doing it, and you don\u2019t have to. We\u2019re going to bring our jobs back. We\u2019re going to make our economy incredible again. My tax proposal, which is in, and a great detail in terms of policy and it\u2019s gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people, a lot of great groups. But we are going to cut taxes tremendously for the middle class and for businesses because our middle class is being decimated. And when that happens, you\u2019re going to see an economy that takes off. We\u2019re going to get rid of a lot of that debt, if not all of it. But we\u2019re going to get rid of it \u2013 you know, we\u2019re at $19 trillion going t $21 trillion right. You know, if you go back eight or nine years, trillion wasn\u2019t even a word anybody knew and now it\u2019s like routine. So we are going to save your Social Security without cuts. We\u2019re going to bring the economy back. We\u2019re going to make ourselves rich again. A woman said to me in New Hampshire recently, she said, \u201cMr. Trump, I\u2019m voting for you. I love you. But it\u2019s very crude when you say you\u2019re going to make our country rich again.\u201d I said, \u201cI know it\u2019s crude. It sounds bad. But many things I say are crude. It sounds bad. But we can\u2019t make our country great again unless we make our country rich again.

I don\u2019t care.\u201d But I do care. I do care so much about it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here all the time. And then the lies happened. You know, when I was using Iowa, they lied so much. I said, \u201cThe people of Iowa can\u2019t be that stupid or the people of the country can\u2019t \u2013 \u201c. I\u2019m trying to make a point, right?

I was talking about something, and I won\u2019t even mention what I\u2019m talking about because the guy I\u2019m talking about and was actually a very good guy. But I will say this. We want to win Iowa so bad. Because if I win Iowa, I think we\u2019d run the table. I really do. I think we\u2019d run the table. We\u2019d go right through. Because we\u2019re leading big in New Hampshire \u2013 every poll. Big. Big in New Hampshire. Christie got an endorsement from this crazy newspaper up there. It\u2019s the weirdest deal I\u2019ve ever seen. And you know the paper that was in his state called up and said, \u201cAre you sure about that? Nobody ever called us.\u201d They can\u2019t believe it. And we can get into that but it\u2019s irrelevant. But we\u2019re leading New Hampshire big. We\u2019re leading in South Carolina like monstrous numbers. We\u2019re leading\u2026Nevada. We\u2019re leading in Texas. We\u2019re leading everywhere. We\u2019re leading big in Florida. Now, you have Rubio \u2013 nice guy, by the way. You have Rubio and he is a nice guy but you\u2019ve got to vote. When people put you in a position to be a Senator, you\u2019ve got to go and vote. You can\u2019t be the number one person that doesn\u2019t vote in the Senate. You\u2019ve got to say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m a young guy. I want to go and vote.\u201d You should stay there a little longer. He\u2019s a good guy. Stay there, go in, vote, create a nice record. But I don\u2019t know. How\u2019s he doing in Iowa? Not too good. Right? He\u2019s not doing well. How\u2019s Rubio doing? Not good. I mean, it seems like a two-person race right now\u2026and it\u2019s an important race to me. So I just want to let you know it\u2019s very important. So with all of that, if we win Iowa, a lot of people say we\u2019d just go through. I think we\u2019ll win virtually every state in the Union and it\u2019s over quickly. Over quickly. \u2026What about the Republican establishment? The establishment\u2019s got a problem, you know. It\u2019s sort of like the fighters. You know, the great champions. Sometimes they\u2019ll go into the hometown of a guy they\u2019re fighting and they\u2019ll say, \u201cYou know, we\u2019d never want to get a decision. We go for the knock-out. The knock-out is the knock-out.\u201d Because you get a lot of bad decisions. I know a lot about the world of sports, believe me, and they go into a hometown to fight and it\u2019s a decision and they say, \u201cUh, we\u2019re in a problem\u201d and they\u2019d lose the fight that they won. The only way they win the fight definitely \u2013 knock out. So, if we win Iowa, I think we\u2019re going to win everything after that. So I think it\u2019s going to show how important Iowa is. \u2026I\u2019ll pledge this to Iowa. Even if I lose, I\u2019ll pledge it, okay? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said that in my life. If we go and win, Iowa\u2019s staying right where it is in the chain. It\u2019s not moving. You know, there\u2019s a big move to move Iowa into a much further back position by the establishment.

She will write \u2013 so \u2013 it\u2019s such misrepresentation. And so I don\u2019t care. I mean, who cares? So I\u2019m saying it right in their backyard. They\u2019re failing anyway. They probably won\u2019t be in business in two years. I think they\u2019re losing a fortune. I think. You know, it\u2019s funny. Every time the Des Moines Register does a poll, I always do badly. \u2026I\u2019m only doing this so they don\u2019t sue me but I don\u2019t mind if they do. I hope they sue me because they don\u2019t have enough money to sue me. That\u2019s the good thing.

I\u2019ll explain it\u2026You know, if they lose 20 people in the pocket. \u201cOh, Trump? Oh, forget that one. Forget that one.\u201d Now, I don\u2019t know that they do that. Do you do that, Des Moines Register? But every time I have a Des Moines Register poll, I do poorly. I also do poorly with the Bloomberg polls. I don\u2019t know why. But we had a great poll come in \u2013 CNN last couple of days \u2013 where we\u2019re leading I think by 13 points in Iowa. In Iowa. And then we have another coming where we\u2019re doing well. But I think Des Moines Register has somebody says it\u2019s coming out sometime. I\u2019ll just tell you, watch \u2013 \u201cTrump disappears!\u201d I think we\u2019re going to do so well. I think we\u2019re actually going to even do better. You know, we\u2019re leading in most of the poll. We\u2019re leading in every poll. Except Iowa there was one poll \u2013 there was one poll, Monmouth \u2013 I\u2019d never even heard Monmouth. What the hell is Monmouth? What is Monmouth? Explain it. I don\u2019t like Monmouth. You know why I don\u2019t like it? Because they always treat me badly also. But I only like polls that treat me well. But we\u2019re doing so well. Nationwide, we\u2019re leading every poll by tremendous. We just had one in Georgia \u2013 44%. 44%. Think of that. That\u2019s 44% with 15 people. I\u2019d take 44% if we had three people. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d take it if we had two people but I think I\u2019d take if we had three. But 44%. CBS came out as you know, you probably saw that, New York Times two days ago and we\u2019re at 35% to a small number. We\u2019re killing everybody in every poll. Just one little outlier here. \u2026Again, I\u2019m sure when Des Moines comes out it\u2019ll be a negative because I don\u2019t believe that poll. But we are going to win. And I\u2019ll tell you what. Honestly, Iowa is so important to me. I could say, \u201cOh, let\u2019s not do\u201d \u2013 I am an evangelical. I am a Christian. I\u2019m a Presbyterian. I\u2019m a Presbyterian. I love Billy Graham. Franklin Graham came out with the most beautiful statements. Franklin Graham. He was so incredible. He came out \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you all saw the statements he came out with about Trump\u2026He was so incredible. Franklin Graham was amazing, the son of Billy Graham, who was, you know, there\u2019s nobody, nobody that I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 Billy Graham was unbelievable. If anybody\u2019s gone to his crusades, they were incredible. But so I think we\u2019re going to do \u2013 we\u2019re doing really well with the evangelicals\u2026 And by the way and again, I do like Ted Cruz but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba in all fairness. It\u2019s true. Not a lot come out. But I like him nevertheless. I think we\u2019re going to do great and we are doing great with evangelicals. We\u2019re doing great with the Tea Party, leading with the Tea Party. And we\u2019re doing fantastic with all the young and middle. We\u2019re doing great with everybody.

What happened is with Paris, there\u2019s a different mindset. And when the polls came out last week, my numbers went way up because people felt more secure with me. Now, maybe it had to do \u2013 who knows why? Who knows? But my poll numbers went up. And do you ever notice whenever there\u2019s something that I do that\u2019s proper but controversial, they\u2019d say \u201cOh, now he\u2019s gone. That\u2019s it.

We have 20,000. 35,000 people in Mobile, Alabama. 20,000 people in Oklahoma. Wherever we go in Iowa, we have these crowds. You know this is supposed to be\u2026for like a record. It is big and yet it feels intimate. It feels good\u2026 \u2026So I changed a couple of weeks ago. When I saw Paris I changed. And a big, big part of what I\u2019m doing now is safety and security and smartness and smartness. Sort of interesting. You know, the slogan is \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and I\u2019m adding \u201cMake America Great Again and Safe Again\u201d because we don\u2019t feel safe anymore. And the problem we have now that we\u2019ve never had to this extent is the power of weaponry. It\u2019s the power. It\u2019s the tremendous power. You know, 100 years ago, I would have said \u201cLet\u2019s not go.\u201d I said \u201cDon\u2019t go there\u201d anyway. And I said it strongly \u201cDon\u2019t go.

And don\u2019t worry, they never pan the crowd. You know, they never; they have me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m walking around. I figured I\u2019ll walk around maybe they\u2019ll get the crowd. They never pan the crowd. I tell them \u201cPan the crowd\u201d, they never do. \u2026I had a crowd 7,000 people last week. More. 7,000 people and in a confined space. They had 3,000 people outside that couldn\u2019t get in. My wife says, \u201cDarling, the speech was excellent. Did you have many people there?\u201d I said \u201cWhat?\u201d She said, \u201cWell, they never leave your face.\u201d They keep it purposely.

But every time there\u2019s a protester \u201cWell, I\u2019m protesting\u201d and it can be in the back lefthand corner of the room, the cameras swoop over there. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. No, I used to think they couldn\u2019t move. You know, maybe there\u2019s something with the crazy computers. You know, in the old days everything was better right? The car seats. You\u2019d sit in your car and you want to move forward and back, you press a button. Bing, bing. Now, you have to open up things, press a computer, takes you 15 minutes. Well, the same thing I figured with cameras. I didn\u2019t think they moved. I figured they were fixed for certain reasons.

You know, when we first came out, we were all talking together. And we were talking border security, which we\u2019re just doing so great with the border security. We\u2019re going to build a wall. Mexico\u2019s going to pay for the wall. We all know that. But we\u2019re going to have security.

That\u2019s the way. And it affects Iowa so much. So we were talking about. So we were talking about that. We were talking about repealing Obamacare. Boom. It\u2019s going to be repealed. It\u2019s going to be replaced. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been seeing what\u2019s happening but Obamacare is a total disaster. It\u2019s dying of its own weight.

There\u2019s been a lot of talk about it and a lot of stories about it. Obamacare\u2019s dead but we\u2019ll terminate it quicker than that. And we will come up with something that will be so good, so much better. Premiums are going through the roof. Deductibles are so high that unless you\u2019re close to death, you\u2019ll never going to get to use. And even then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get to use it really. So, we\u2019re going to take care of that. And by the way, we have a lot of good people. We have ethanol. Nobody is really \u2013 we have the ethanol \u2013 where are the ethanol people? Right? I was here a month ago and I met with them all and they do a fantastic job. I toured the plants and they do a fantastic job but it\u2019s so important.

I mean, everything I say he agrees with me. No matter what I say. I was going to do one really wild but he agrees. But with the ethanol, really, he\u2019s got to come a long way because he\u2019s right now for the oil. But I understand it. Oil pays him a lot of money. He\u2019s got to be for oil, right? The oil companies give him a lot of money. But I\u2019m with you. I\u2019m with everybody. Look, I\u2019m self funding. I have no oil company. I have no special interest. I have no lobbyist that want me and you know, they\u2019re representing countries that are ripping off the country, they\u2019re representing companies that are ripping off our country. All I do is I\u2019m going to be working for you folks. We\u2019re going to do this thing together. We\u2019re going to make America so great again and maybe better than ever before. So important.

Nabisco\u2019s moving there with their big plant. Ford is moving there with a big plant. They took a big plant away from Tennessee \u2013 a great state \u2013 they took it away at the last moment.

The nation has looked back on events in our past, for example, the Chinese Exclusion Act or the internment of Japanese-American citizens and realized it was a huge mistake to make one significant group our enemy. It is inconsistent with the vision of our Constitution in which all came to the United States seeking to escape persecution and being able to practice whichever religion they chose. The founders of the United States did not seek to make our nation one which only a single religion could be practiced. They did not seek to establish one religion as a preeminent religion. They instead wanted a place \u2013 a safe haven \u2013 where people could worship as they pleased, which is the heart of our First Amendment. This idea is wrong and wrongheaded. It is wrong in the context that we are not at war with Islam. In fact, we are working with partnership with Islamic nations to take on a terrorist group known as ISIS. It is wrong in that all patriotic Americans of every religion are working together to take on this terrorist group known as ISIS. In addition to being wrong, it\u2019s wrongheaded and that making Islam the enemy is playing straight out of ISIS playbook, which wants to create a war between America and Islam. And in that sense, this type of irresponsible statement endangers our national security rather than strengthening it. So let others stand up and embrace our citizens of every religion and recognize the partnership we are in together to take on terrorist forces, that we\u2019re working in partnership with a variety of nations that have a whole variety of religions, including Islam, to take on the terrorist force known as ISIS\u2026 ", "name": "Transcript: Sen.

I know right now that many Americans feel unsafe and unsure. The people deserve to know that we are taking decisive action to protect ourselves and to tackle this threat. The day after the attack, the Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy put together a task force to weigh new actions that Congress could take, including recommendations made by our homeland security\u2026 First, the House voted to strengthen the certification requirements for our Syrian refugee program. That was a big bipartisan vote \u2013 a veto-override majority bipartisan vote. Today, the House will vote to strengthen the nation\u2019s visa waiver program, another product of this task force. This will help neutralize the threat from foreign terrorists entering our country. We expect this to be another big bipartisan vote. So we are coming together to tackle this threat and we are ready to do more. That is why we need the president to put forward a real comprehensive strategy to defeat \u2013 defeat, not contain \u2013 ISIS. On Sunday night, we heard the president defend staying the course. But why would we stay the course when the enemy is evolving? If we lead from behind, we will remain one step behind. Defeating the enemy is going to take time. It\u2019s going to take all of our heart and all of our might. But we will persevere and make no mistake, we will win. Finally, when we voted to pause the refugee program a few weeks ago, I made very clear at the time, there would not be a religious test. There would be a security test. And that is because freedom of religion \u2013 freedom of religion \u2013 is a fundamental constitutional principle. It\u2019s a founding principle of this country. Normally, I do not comment on what\u2019s going on in the presidential election. I will take an exception today. This is not conservatism. What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for and more importantly, it\u2019s not what this country stands for. Not only are there many Muslims serving in our armed forces dying for this country, there are Muslims serving right here in the House working everyday to uphold and to defend the Constitution. Some of our best and biggest allies in this struggle and fight against radical Islamic terror are Muslims, the vast, vast, vast majority of whom are peaceful, who believe in pluralism and freedom, democracy, individual rights. I told our members this morning to always strive to live up to our highest ideals, to uphold those principles in our Constitution on which we swear every two years that we will defend. That\u2019s why we are here and that is why we are going to stay here in the people\u2019s House to do the people\u2019s work.

The whole carnival barker routine that we\u2019ve seen for some time now. The question now is about the rest of the Republican Party and whether or not they\u2019re going to be dragged into the dust bin of history with them and right now the kind of trajectory is not very good. Earlier this year, House Republicans elected to their leadership somebody who famously bragged to a reporter that he\u2019s David Duke without the baggage. Earlier this month, we saw the executive director of the Senate Republican campaign committee was advising candidates about how they could ride the Trump wave. And just today, the newly elected Speaker of the House said that he would vote for Donald Trump for President if he\u2019s the party\u2019s nominee. Now, I know that each of the Republican candidates has already taken an oath pledging to support Donald Trump for president of the United States if he wins the nomination. But the fact is the first thing a president does when he or she takes [office] is to swear an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. And the fact is that what Donald Trump said yesterday disqualifies him from serving as president. And for Republican candidates for president to stand by their pledge to support Mr. Trump, that in and of itself is disqualifying\u2026 ", "name": "Transcript: White House spokesman Josh Earnest\u2019s remarks on Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S."}, {"text": "I took a deep breath and I went down and I talked about lots of things, including illegal immigration.

Rush Limbaugh said \u201cThe most incredible incoming that I\u2019ve ever seen a human being endure\u201d. And then he doubled down a week later because I was right. And now, illegal immigration is one of the biggest things. And then you had the killing of Kate [Steinle] and the killing of Jamiel and the killing recently in California of a 66-year-old \u2013 think of it, 66-year-old \u2013 veteran, female, raped, sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant. And many, many more. It\u2019s a huge problem. And they take our jobs and a lot of other things.

A little thing \u2013 Wollman ice skating rink. The city couldn\u2019t get it built for high years. They were in there for like $20 million. They couldn\u2019t get it done. I went to the mayor of New York, I said, \u201cEd Koch, I\u2019ll get it done real quick.\u201d He didn\u2019t like it because he didn\u2019t want to be shown up. I said I\u2019ll do it and if it costs more than $2 million I\u2019ll pay for it. I got it built for peanuts. Got it done in four months. And we had ice skating in Central Park and I still run it. I did another one \u2013 I did a bigger version of that recently Ferry Point out in the Bronx. They were having \u2013 things have been under construction from anywhere between 20 and 30 years. They couldn\u2019t get it done. I got it done under a year. It\u2019s operating now. It\u2019s very successful. It\u2019s what I do and that\u2019s what we need. That\u2019s what we need in our country. I\u2019m building on Pennsylvania Avenue an incredible hotel. One of the great hotels of the world. The Old Post Office site. Think of it. I got it in the Obama administration. Everybody was bidding. Everybody wanted it. One of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA \u2013 general services. And I got it. Can you imagine me getting it from the Obama administration? Because the GSA, who are really professionals, they want to make sure number one that it got built. So they wanted strong financials. And they also wanted a great plan. So we came up with Ivanka and my kids we came up with this incredible plan. The job is under budget, ahead of schedule. It was going to open up in \u201917 \u2013 sometime during the year \u201917. Now, it\u2019s going to open probably in September of \u201916 right before the election on Pennsylvania Avenue.

Pfizer\u2019s leaving the United States. In the old days, somebody would leave for, frankly, South Carolina. They\u2019d leave New York or Florida or someplace where the taxes are lower. They\u2019d leave for North Carolina. They\u2019d leave \u2013 today they\u2019d leave this country for other countries. So now, we\u2019re losing Pfizer. We\u2019re losing many of our great companies. We have $2.5 trillion offshore at least. And everybody agrees it should come home \u2013 the Democrats, the Republicans. For three years, they can\u2019t make a deal. They can\u2019t make a deal because there\u2019s such gridlock. There\u2019s no leadership in Washington. We will make this country so great.

They didn\u2019t mention at one of their meetings? I think they had breakfast like everyday or every other day. They\u2019d just say, \u201cChris, tonight we\u2019re closing up the George Washington Bridge because the mayor a certain area is against you.\u201d \u201cOh, okay.\u201d They didn\u2019t mention? Nobody believes that. Number two. Nine downgrades of the state. Nine downgrades. It\u2019s a disaster. I have property over there \u2013 the taxes are through \u2013 I\u2019ll use an expression \u2013 coming out of my ears, okay? Tremendous taxes over there. You had nine downgrades. You had Christie, you know, so friendly with President Obama during the flood. I actually called. I said, \u201cLet me ask you. Is he going to vote for Obama?\u201d I thought he was going to vote for Obama. I don\u2019t know. I think he possibly did. And Romney I was very disappointed. One of the reasons I was disappointed was he called Christie and had dinner right after the election. If Christie did that to me, I would have never spoken to him again. I would have never done it. So when Chris talks about \u2013 when he talks about lack of experience \u2013 I built this incredible company. I filed papers where everyone said \u201cWow, that is unbelievable.\u201d I would have probably filed them even when I didn\u2019t run because I built a great, great company. Tremendous cash. Tremendous assets. Tremendous net worth. Very little debt. Unbelievable cash flow. And I filed. Everybody said \u201cNumber one, he won\u2019t run.\u201d And I ran. I took a deep breath and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d to my wife and we came down that escalator. Right, the famous escalators. Hopefully in many years that will be a very famous scene because we will have turned around our country and that will be a positive note, okay? But then they said, \u201cOh, well he announced.\u201d So these talking heads \u2013 most of whom are not even smart people, believe me. Then they\u2019d say well, they went to Ivy League college. So did I go to Ivy League college. They went to this. Most of them didn\u2019t go to Ivy League colleges by the way but they say they\u2019re brilliant. One\u2019s brilliant because he wears glasses, you know? Like Perry. Remember Perry? We don\u2019t like him.

Then they said, \u201cWell, he\u2019ll never sign his financial statement because maybe he\u2019s not as rich as everybody thinks.\u201d Then they said, \u201cAnd if he does, he\u2019ll ask for many, many delays because you\u2019re entitled to 45 day delays, delays, and you can delay it until forever. And they\u2019ll delay it until after the election.\u201d I said, \u201cNo\u201d so I filed it ahead of schedule. And what happened? Remember? They went down. They couldn\u2019t believe it. It was much, much, much better than anybody ever envisioned. I built a great company and the reason \u2013 honestly worth billions and billions of dollars.

In North Carolina, I have a great piece of property. Trump National Golf Club. Some of you know it. Great, right at the best location. And what happens? What happens?

They never thought I was going to run. And I told the story the other night for really the first real time. But my wife said to me \u201cYou know if you run you will win. Don\u2019t you?\u201d She\u2019s very smart. I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t run, you\u2019re never going to poll before. Nobody believes you\u2019re going to run.\u201d So if they do polls like they did these early polls, they weren\u2019t great before I announced. She said, \u201cNo, the only way you\u2019re going to get a poll number is you\u2019ve got to announce.\u201d Nobody believes even though they say, even though they say you\u2019re running, it doesn\u2019t matter.

You remember I took a deep breath because I\u2019m telling you and you know what I\u2019m talking about the press down there look like the Academy Awards. There were so many cameras.

Does that make sense by the way? Until we find out. And he talked about \u2013 that\u2019s inexperience and you know in other words he has experience right? But that\u2019s the statement of an inexperienced man\u2026About we have to stop people that want to kill us from coming in. Does that sound like inexperienced? So Chris, who\u2019s a friend of mine, he hit me hard. And I said I got to hit him at least once. So I won\u2019t do this a lot. Look, here\u2019s the story. The George Washington Bridge.

Trump is calling for \u2013 now, you\u2019ve got to listen to this because this is pretty heavy stuff and it\u2019s common sense and we have to do it. Remember the poll numbers. 25%, 51%.

Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice. We have no choice. According to Pew Research, among others, there is a great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from Center for Security Policy released data showing 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans \u2013 these are people that are here by the way, people that are here \u2013 25% not 1%. By the way, 1% would be unacceptable. 1% is unacceptable. 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part \u2013 think of that \u2013 as part of the global jihad. They want to change your religion. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. Not going to happen. As part of the global jihad. And 51% of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. 51%. Sharia authorizes \u2013 now look, this is, I mean, it\u2019s terrible. Sharia authorizes such atrocities as murders against non-believers who won\u2019t convert, beheadings, and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans especially women. I mean, you look \u2013 especially women. Tough stuff. And we have a president that won\u2019t even mention the term and you\u2019re talking about numbers like this. Mr. Trump stated without looking at the various polling data, it\u2019s obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension\u2026 Where the hatred comes from and why, we\u2019ll have to determine. We\u2019ll have to figure it out. We have to figure it out. We can\u2019t live like this. It\u2019s going to get worse and worse. You\u2019re going to have more World Trade Centers. It\u2019s going to get worse and worse folks. We could be politically correct and we can be stupid but it\u2019s going to get worse and worse. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad. These are people only believe in jihad. They don\u2019t want our system. They don\u2019t want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. They have no respect for human life.

Amazingly, there\u2019s a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC. She\u2019s back there. Little Katie. She\u2019s back there. What a lie it was. No, what a lie \u2013 Katie Tur \u2013 what a lie it was from NBC to have written that. It was a total lie.

I loved it. And then other people pick it up. You know it\u2019s NBC so somebody picks it up. Third rate reporter. Remember that. Third rate. Third rate. So I said here the mainstream media wants to surrender our Constitution and our constitutional rights. And I don\u2019t want that. I want ISIS to surrender. Okay? I want ISIS to surrender.

They\u2019re coming \u2013 not coming at me. They\u2019re coming at all of us. They\u2019re coming at all of us. Because you know, we have a noisy majority. They used to call it the quiet majority. People are fed up. They\u2019re fed up with incompetence. They\u2019re fed up with stupid leaders. They\u2019re fed up with stupid people. They are fed up with stupid people, where our president makes a deal for Sergeant Bergdahl, a dirty, rotten, no good traitor who \u2013 think of it. They knew he was a traitor because a general and a colonel went to see his group. Six people were killed looking for him. Okay? Six people were killed. Young. Unbelievable. I watched the parents on television. I\u2019ve seen the parents. But I watched the parents on television devastated, will never be the same. They left to try to bring them back. He left. He deserted. You know, in the old days when we were strong country it would be boom, gone. It was called desertion. Now I heard the other day they won\u2019t even do anything to him. Can you believe it? They think he\u2019s going to get away with nothing. He\u2019s going to have nothing. So he left. Oh, they treated him pretty rough though. He got in there, he said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done this. This isn\u2019t working out the way I thought.\u201d Anyways, so we get him back and here\u2019s the deal we made. We get a dirty, no good traitor. Six people killed\u2026They get five of their greatest killers that they\u2019ve been after \u2013 after \u2013 think of it for six years. In fact, I hear nine years. So they get these \u2013 right now have gone \u2013 they\u2019re out in the battlefield, trying to kill everybody in front of them including you folks, I\u2019d hate to tell you. So we get Bergdahl and they get five of the killers that they\u2019ve wanted for many years. That\u2019s the way we do it.  The Iran deal. We gave them $150 billion. It\u2019s called amateur night. We gave them $150 billion. 24 days \u2013 24 days \u2013 we think there\u2019s something wrong, 24 days we have to wait but it\u2019s much longer than that because there\u2019s a whole process before the clock starts ticking. So it could be forever. But the best is where they have the right to self-inspect. \u201cAre you doing nuclear weapons over there?\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019ll inspect tomorrow.\u201d \u201cOh no, we\u2019re not doing nuclear weapons.\u201d You know, the Persians are great negotiators. Always have been. And somebody would say that\u2019s profiling. Trust me, they\u2019re great negotiators. And Kerry is a horrible negotiator and Obama is a horrible negotiator. Horrible. He\u2019s a horrible negotiator. These people are horrible. I always Obama would be a unifier. I never thought of him as being like a divider because I said \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be a good president.\u201d I backed McCain; he lost by the way. And you know, I don\u2019t blame McCain for losing because a lot of bad things will happen; it was a tough one. But I backed McCain; he lost. I backed Romney; he should have won but he sort of went away on vacation or something the last month and he lost. And I said, \u201cThis time I\u2019m going to do it myself. We\u2019re not going to lose.\u201d We\u2019re not going to lose. We\u2019re not losing. And the recent Fox poll that just came out has me beating Hillary very easily one on one. I love that.

Give me a break. We\u2019re like the stupid country in so many different ways. It\u2019s so \u2013 can you imagine what our great leaders of the past would have said with the kind of crap that\u2019s happening with us? They didn\u2019t want to report them because they thought it was profiling. Okay, they saw bombs. They saw, you know, the pipe bombs only this wasn\u2019t to build a bathroom. When a bomb is this long, can\u2019t put too many of them together for a bathroom, right? And we thought they maybe but we didn\u2019t want to racially profile. Oh, okay, you\u2019re okay, you\u2019re innocent. Or how about where the families and the girlfriends and the wives and everything and they go back to World Trade Center \u2013 the worst, worse than Pearl Harbor because with the World Trade Center they were killing innocent civilians. At least while it was a dirty, rotten sneak attack, at least they were\u2026but while it was an attack, at least it was military. But this was an attack on the World Trade Center. So, what\u2019s happened is we\u2019re out of control. We have no idea who\u2019s coming into our country. We have no idea if they love us or if they hate us. We have no idea if they want to bomb us. We have no idea what\u2019s going on. And then I looked at poll numbers and I don\u2019t mean polls where I\u2019m winning; those numbers I like looking at. These numbers I hated to look at. And it\u2019s very, very sad. I\u2019ll go after some of the numbers. 25% of those polled and this was from the Center for Security Policy \u2013 very highly respected group of people who I know actually. This is people living in this country. 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans is justified as Muslims. 25%. 51% of the Muslims living in this country \u2013 by the way, I have friends that are Muslims; they\u2019re great people. But they know we have a problem. They know we have a real problem. Because something\u2019s going on, and we can\u2019t put up with it, folks. We can\u2019t put up with it. 51% \u2013 51% highly respected number of polling groups want to be governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. So I wrote this out. The mainstream media wants to surrender the Constitution. The mainstream media \u2013 these people back here. They\u2019re the worst. They are so dishonest. No, no, they\u2019re so dishonest. They are so dishonest. I mean, I have one from NBC, a reporter from NBC, and actually another one from CBS, they actually in Columbus, Ohio, I had a tremendous crowd like 10,000 people. It was a love fest. It went on for a long time. Everybody stayed right \u2019tis the end. I had one of the politicians \u2013 Kasich \u2013 who is just getting \u2013 he\u2019s a horrible debater\u2026He made a statement that \u201cOh, they left after 10 minutes.\u201d Now, the press was there. They saw it. Nobody said it was a lie. It was a total lie. In fact, I had more people at the end than I had at the beginning. Nobody\u2019s leaving. Nobody\u2019s leaving here except for the one person that was screaming. So, we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didn\u2019t want to do that because it\u2019s not their thing to do. You know, we get the biggest crowds. They don\u2019t want to show this crowd tonight. They\u2019re not going to show all the people outside trying to get in. They don\u2019t do that. They have the cameras right in my face. I say fan the crowd just to show \u2013 look at all the people over here. It\u2019s a record in the history of this ship. But they don\u2019t show it. They don\u2019t show it. No, no.

You have Cruz at 20% and Carson at 16% and going down and Rubio at 11% and Bush at 4%. But it\u2019s Trump at 33%. It just came out. It\u2019s Iowa \u2013 we love Iowa. By the way, great ship named after Iowa too. I\u2019ve been on that one too. A really great one. The other big poll that came out just two days ago was the national poll. Trump 36% and then I won\u2019t even mention the other numbers because they\u2019re so low. You know, when you have so many people running \u2013 we had 17 and then they started to drop. Ding. Bing. I love it. I love it. And you\u2019ll be losing a lot over the next little while. I would imagine. I don\u2019t know. When somebody\u2019s down at zero I would think that eventually they\u2019ll drop out. The only difference is there\u2019s nothing to pick up if there is zero. What do you pick up? So anyways you\u2019ll be seeing that. One of the things I think that\u2019s so important because to me very important in the same poll, which is the big national CNN poll, on the economy \u2013 so important \u2013 Trump 55%. Everyone else nothing. On the budget \u2013 I\u2019m really good at these things \u2013 economy, budgets. I sort of expected this. On the budget, Trump \u2013 this is with 15 people remaining \u2013 Trump 51%. Everyone else bing. Oh, here\u2019s one that I started and I took a lot of heat. I took a lot of heat. Sort of like the one we\u2019re talking about today. I guess you\u2019ve heard a little bit about it. But I\u2019ve taken a lot of heat on this one. Illegal immigration. Now, had I not brought that up in Trump Tower in June when I announced that I was going to run for president, which takes courage to run for president, believe me. You know, all of my life, I\u2019ve heard that if you\u2019re a successful person, especially if you have very success \u2013 you\u2019ve done a lot of things, a lot of deals, a lot of everything, you can\u2019t run for president. And yet, that\u2019s the kind of mindset and thinking this country needs. We\u2019re being run by people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. Very sad. On illegal immigration, Trump 48%. That\u2019s with 15 people. Everyone else, no good. On a thing called ISIS\u2026oh, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have plenty \u2013 we\u2019ll talk a lot about ISIS. Can you believe it? Here we have generals. They go on television and talk. They do all talk. You people \u2013 a lot of military people here. Who\u2019s military here? All right, I love you. By the way, speaking of it, we\u2019re going to make our military so strong, so powerful, so great, nobody\u2019s ever going to mess with us again. Nobody. They\u2019re never going to mess with us.

You look at some of the things that she\u2019s saying right now. But I\u2019ll tell you what, whether she is or not, she doesn\u2019t have the strength or the energy to help Israel. I\u2019m telling you she doesn\u2019t. \u2026But just take a look. She\u2019ll come out and do an event and you don\u2019t see her for another four days, three days, five days. No, it\u2019s true. Think of it. We don\u2019t need \u2013 some people say it\u2019s not nice to say. She doesn\u2019t have the strength or the energy. Israel needs more than just our support. They need strength. They need real power behind them. Because you know, you look at as these countries fall over there, Israel\u2019s looking more and more \u2013 you know, Israel has some difficulties. And one thing and I think you\u2019ll all admit it. These people are fighting really dirty but they fight a lot better than we used to think. Right? We used to think \u201cOh, that was easy.\u201d 15 years ago with my friends from Israel because I have a lot of friends from Israel, they used to smile and laugh \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Now they\u2019re saying, \u201cThese guys are \u2013 they\u2019re dirty fighters.\u201d And they\u2019re not bad. You know, they\u2019re tough. They\u2019re not the JV. Okay? Obama said they\u2019re the JV. They\u2019re not the JV folks. We need tough. We need General George Patton. We need General MacArthur. We don\u2019t need the guys we have. I see them on television \u2013 generals. I don\u2019t want my generals on television saying \u201cWell, ISIS is very tough.\u201d I saw a guy the other day. ISIS is very tough. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t need that. Do you think General George Patton \u2013 they don\u2019t like him because he was a foul mouth vicious horrible brilliant guy. So he would never make it. They probably would have had him thrown out years ago. But we need Patton. We need a genius like MacArthur. And we have those people. We have those people. I\u2019ll find that person. But we\u2019re going to knock the crap out of them, I\u2019ll tell you what. We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win. Question on the greatest challenges facing the U.S.: But radical Islam is \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you one thing I know isn\u2019t is global warming. That\u2019s the one thing\u2026I know isn\u2019t. I mean, we have a guy that just the other day who said \u2013 here they want to blow everything \u2013 this is right after Paris. They want to blow our cities up. They want to destroy our civilization, and he\u2019s worried about global warming, which a lot of people think is a hoax. By the way, I won so many environmental awards shockingly. No, it\u2019s true. And you know what I want to do? I want really immaculate air. I want clean, crystal water. I want a lot of things. Okay? I want a lot of things. But global warming \u2013 you noticed they changed the name \u2013 they go global warming, they go climate change, they go \u2013 now I hear a lot of extreme weather. How can you miss with extreme weather, right? If it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s okay. If it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s okay. If it\u2019s windy, if it\u2019s hot \u2013 everything is extreme. So now they use extreme weather. It is a disgrace what\u2019s going on. And to have this man embarrass us by standing up and saying that global warming is our biggest threat, we got to get him out so fast and thank goodness we only have a year left. Thank you.

You\u2019ve got to go in and get it and do it and do it nicely so everyone\u2019s happy. Don\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re going to be very happy. Okay? Don\u2019t worry about it. Question on Netanyahu: And \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ll talk about deals after the fact, which is a shame but I think the Iran deal is the worst single thing. Perhaps it\u2019ll go down \u2013 and I\u2019ve been pretty good at predicting things. I think it\u2019s going to go down as the worst single thing that\u2019s ever happened to Israel. I think it\u2019s a catastrophe for Israel. And I think the fact that Obama was willing to make that deal for anybody that loves Israel to support this guy or even the Democratic Party is impossible to believe. I think it will be one of the great catastrophes. But if I get in, I will straighten it out, believe me. It\u2019s going to be straightened out. It\u2019s going to be straightened out tough and it\u2019s going to be straightened out fast. The one bad thing is if I get in, the $150 billion is gone. That hurts me and that hurts the people of Israel. But the $150 billion is gone because it\u2019ll be gone before you get there. You know, we\u2019re talking about a year and more actually. Although the election very quick. You know, it\u2019s coming up. It\u2019s now less than a year and you know we have the Iowa starts on February 1st and then we go right down the line and it\u2019s very exciting. We\u2019re talking about a couple of months now for it to start. For a person like me, I mean, it\u2019s very exciting. Question on which Arab leaders with whom Trump can work: You know, I told you I made commercials for Bibi. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to help me in the negotiation. I can tell you. You know, I\u2019m trying to keep it nice and level, right? Then I get people screaming at me. But I\u2019m trying to keep it as level as possible but I for the most part don\u2019t know. The King of Jordan seems like a nice man. I mean, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re going to see. A lot of people like him; some people don\u2019t. But I think I will probably be able \u2013 what my history \u2013 you know, I took some heat because I get along with Democrats, I get along with liberals, I get along with conservatives, I get along with Republicans. I get along with everybody. That\u2019s what I was \u2013 I\u2019m a businessperson. I get along with everybody. We have to get along with everybody. And I took some heat and I always explained that. I said, \u201cWait a minute, I\u2019m a businessperson. I\u2019ve got to get along with everybody.\u201d I live in Manhattan. It\u2019s all Democrat. I mean, it\u2019s virtually all \u2013 Republicans don\u2019t even run people for the most part and if they do they get 5%. You know, they get a very small percentage of the vote. Got to get along with everybody. I think that\u2019s going to be a tremendous asset because right now we have gridlock in Washington. We have people that \u2013 they don\u2019t talk. You know, I remember that years ago because I\u2019ve been a very political person on the other side but always very political. But years ago, the Republicans and the Democrats \u2013 they used to like each other. They\u2019d get along. They\u2019d have dinner together. They\u2019d argue and they\u2019d fight and they\u2019d disagree and would have, you know, different views and things. But in the evening, they\u2019d go out and they\u2019d have dinner together with their families. You don\u2019t see that anymore. There\u2019s total hatred and there\u2019s total gridlock. I\u2019ll give you one point, which I think is important. Corporate inversions. Right? So you have companies leaving the United States and they\u2019re leaving because of better taxes and better a lot of things. A lot of things are better. But they\u2019re leaving. Pfizer. How good is Pfizer? Thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be lost. But they\u2019re also leaving because we have $2.5 trillion at least \u2013 I think it\u2019s a much higher number than that. $2.5 trillion \u2013 that\u2019s out of the country that these companies can\u2019t get back because of bureaucracy and horrible trade agreements but because the taxes are too high. They\u2019re so onerous that nobody in this room would agree to pay that much money to get your money out. So they leave it over there and they actually take the company and they move the company to the money because that\u2019s how much money. The Republicans and the Democrats totally agree that the money should come back. For three years they can\u2019t get a deal. There\u2019s no leadership. It\u2019s gridlock. There\u2019s an example of something where everybody agrees \u2013 all the people that you see up here they all agree but they can\u2019t get it done because they\u2019re politicians. They\u2019re all talk; they\u2019re no action. So there\u2019s something and it\u2019s so important. It\u2019s not like something where they don\u2019t get \u2013 like there\u2019s big disputes and we understand that. This is something everybody agrees \u2013 the money should pour into this country and we should use the money and all the things \u2013 taxes paid. But they agree and they can\u2019t get it doen because of gridlock and incompetent leadership.

I mean, it\u2019s taken off like crazy. The hats \u2013 it\u2019s going crazy. But you know, some of these guys try to copy it but I had it trademarked because we\u2019re smart. A couple of them got up. No, you see, I was making this speech and everybody stood up \u2013 make America great again\u2026 But nobody stood up to them. But we sent them a little notice \u2013 don\u2019t use that term. We\u2019re trademarked. Can you imagine I got the approval? But we are \u2013 we\u2019re building a great hotel down the road. I hope you all stay and it\u2019s going to be wonderful\u2026 Question on Trump\u2019s view on Israel\u2019s commitment to peace: And one of the questions was about Israel and the Palestinians what\u2019s going to happen. I said \u2013 I used that as an example of some deals that are maybe the hardest deal ever in history to make\u2026Can we think of any deals? We all have tough deals, right? You know, we have some good, some bad\u2026 But I said people are going to have to make sacrifices one way or the other. I believe \u2013 because I\u2019m a dealmaker \u2013 I believe that I can put both sides together. But I said, it\u2019ll take six months. At the end of six months and maybe sooner \u2013 with us we have a deal instinct. A lot of us. And you can walk into a room and you can almost tell like in two seconds whether or not you\u2019re going to make a deal. I will know very quickly whether or not I\u2019ll be able to put that deal together. I used that in this interview as an example of perhaps the hardest deal in history to put together. There\u2019s probably no tougher deal. If I could do that, it would make me so happy because there\u2019s so much violence, so much death, and just been going on for so many years. Now, I said you have to have a commitment to make it. I don\u2019t know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don\u2019t know that the other side has the commitment to make it. With that being said, you know, I have a good chance of winning because you look at what\u2019s going on. So I have a good chance. I don\u2019t like to as a dealmaker give away a lot of cards by talking about how I feel about this or that. I\u2019d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room. I don\u2019t want one side or the other saying. Look, I think people know where I stand. But wouldn\u2019t it be great if they could make a deal? But a lasting deal, a real deal. Not a phony deal that\u2019s going to last a week and then bad things started happening again. I\u2019d love to \u2013 and I will give it. You know Obama, as you know he said it won\u2019t happen, meaning he gave up on this before it even started. But I think it would be a great thing for Israel \u2013 I think it would be a great actually for both sides if a real deal could be made, and I\u2019m going to give it my best. I\u2019m a great dealmaker. That\u2019s what I do. I made a lot of money. I\u2019m going to give it my best. It would be great if that deal could be made. By the way, Israel has given a lot\u2026And a lot of people don\u2019t know that. I think the public relations for Israel hasn\u2019t been so great because Israel\u2019s given a lot but hasn\u2019t been given a lot of credit for what they\u2019ve given\u2026 In fact, some things have been given which were unthinkable and a lot of turmoil it caused in Israel. There were things given. But I\u2019d like to go in with a clean slate and just say let\u2019s go, everybody\u2019s even, we love everybody, and let\u2019s see if we could do something. But I do think this \u2013 and I do think right from the beginning and that one of the reasons I\u2019m saying it now even though perhaps it comes back to haunt me later on it has to be said that Israel has given a lot. I don\u2019t know whether or not they want to go that far in a little step and you know that\u2019s going to be up to them. But Israel has not been given the credit that they deserve for what they\u2019ve done. I will say that. I will say that. So that\u2019s it.

But they go to Washington and they\u2019re going to do this and they\u2019re going to do budgets \u2013 like I heard the guy before \u201cWe\u2019re going to work in the budget.\u201d It\u2019s all about that. What happens is they\u2019re going to do budgets like we\u2019re going to do this and that and I tell this story \u2013 then they walk into the Capitol Building, which is magnificent, and they look up \u201cDarling, oh my, look at those columns, look at the ceiling, look at the angels. Oh, look at these magnificent floors.\u201d They\u2019ve never seen anything like it. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived.

I want to use a nice word because otherwise they\u2019d get reported for foul language. They lose all of their courage and they\u2019ve let us down. That won\u2019t happen with me.

I can take anybody in this office, believe me, and they\u2019re better than Obama and they\u2019re better than Kerry and they\u2019re better than the foolish people \u2013 the foolish people. It\u2019s so embarrassing when you see what happens. Sergeant Bergdahl, all right? Sergeant Bergdahl \u2013 we get a traitor; they get five of the greatest killers that they\u2019ve wanted for nine years. You know, the deal was five for one. And they knew he was a traitor before we made the deal. You know about Sergeant Bergdahl. He deserted. Six people were killed trying to get him back. They were looking for him. The general and the colonel went to see all those people, they said, \u201cNo, he deserted. He was a traitor.\u201d And we still made the deal. So we get a traitor. We can give him back. Do you want to re-negotiate deals? Some of us will re-negotiate deals. I would say about 99.9 \u2013 is there anybody that doesn\u2019t re-negotiate deals in this room? This room negotiates so I want to re-negotiate \u2013 perhaps more than any room than I\u2019ve ever spoken. Maybe more. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been called on that a couple of times too.

And then you have of course the 24 days and the 24 days we\u2019re all good with contracts don\u2019t start until such and such happens. It could be forever before you ever go into inspect. And we don\u2019t even get our prisoners back. And now they want to start a negotiation to get the prisoners back and they want 19 people for our three. They don\u2019t want to give us our four. You know we have four. But they only want to talk three. Now, that should have been negotiated right at the beginning, three years ago. And maybe better than any audience, I mean, the people in this room understand what I\u2019m saying. It should have been you walk in \u2013 by the way, did you ever see a negotiation take so long? And we conceded on every single. We didn\u2019t win anything. We didn\u2019t win anything. But that should have been with our prisoners \u2013 day one, whatever it is years ago, we have to get our prisoners back. You don\u2019t want them. We need them. It will make us look better. Both everybody is going to like us more. With the American public, any deal that we strike, it\u2019s going to look good. And you say that. We have to get our prisoners back. Day one. They\u2019re going to say, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not giving.\u201d And we\u2019re going to say, \u201cBye bye. Bye! Call us when you\u2019re ready.\u201d And then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions. I guarantee you within 48 hours they\u2019re calling, begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back. It\u2019s so easy. Now, the president, you saw that, and John Kerry, who is probably the worst negotiator I\u2019ve ever seen. No, he\u2019s the worst negotiator I\u2019ve ever seen. He did not read The Art of the Deal, folks, I can tell you that. Now, he\u2019s one of the few. He\u2019s one of the \u2013 biggest selling of all time business book of all time, he didn\u2019t read it. And Obama definitely didn\u2019t read it. Obama, ayeyeye. Oh. But they said \u2013 this is hard to believe but this is what they said \u2013 a lot of press back there so I have to say everything exactly correct because if I don\u2019t I end up with a \u2013 they said we didn\u2019t want to complicate the negotiations by asking for the prisoners. It\u2019s really complicated. We want our prisoners back. Oh, so complicated. They said they didn\u2019t want to complicate \u2013 so now, we\u2019re going to end up making a new deal probably at some point. I\u2019d tell you this, look I\u2019ll just tell you this: If I win, before I take office, I guarantee you those prisoners are going to be back. They\u2019re going to be back, I guarantee you. They\u2019re going to be back. Now, our president doesn\u2019t want to use the term \u2013 we had another event, which probably was \u2013 the one yesterday \u2013 probably was related. It always happens but it probably was. When I heard about it, I figured maybe not. But it turns out probably was related \u2013 radical Islamic terrorism. And I\u2019ll tell you what, we have a president that refuses to use the term. He refuses to say. There\u2019s something going on with him that we don\u2019t know about. Now, as far as Hillary\u2019s concerned, she\u2019s going to go with what he wants. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. What she did is criminal with the emails. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. She\u2019s going to have to follow his line because she\u2019s on a thread. You know, look, in real life, his Attorney General, his U.S. Attorney, his Attorney General. So his Attorney General is going to listen to him in my opinion. I think it\u2019s very dishonest what\u2019s going on with our government. Gen. [David] Petraeus was given a life-changing sentence. Other people have been sent to jail. Petraeus was, you know, essentially \u2013 look, I don\u2019t want to get into it with the poor guy. What he went \u2013 for nothing, compared to what she did for nothing, for 5% of what she did. And Obama, I mean, she can\u2019t go against him because only does boom she gets indicted. That\u2019s the end of it. That\u2019s the end of it. So when you see Hillary backing up virtually everything he says, and he\u2019s got control of her. I mean, it\u2019s just total control. But I\u2019ll tell you what, she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. What she did was a criminal act. And remember this, this is a six-year \u2013 you have a six year statute of limitations. So she\u2019s fighting for her life. If she doesn\u2019t become president, she could have a real problem. Does that make any sense to anybody? Does that make sense to anybody? Because what she did was just wrong. Okay? And you know she\u2019s been involved in corruption her whole life, whether it\u2019s Whitewater. I mean, her whole life is corruption.

You know, I\u2019ve devoted so much time over my life to Israel, and the other politicians they can talk but believe me they haven\u2019t done what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve received many, many awards. I was the Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade at a very dangerous time when people said, \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d I walked up Fifth Avenue. I\u2019m looking up for lots of trouble. But I said, \u201cNo way am I not going to do it.\u201d And it was a rough time as you know. It was 2004, and it was a tremendously successful parade. Maybe their most successful parade that they ever had. So, I\u2019m in a different position than the other candidates because I\u2019m the one candidate I don\u2019t want any of your money; I want your support but I don\u2019t want your money. I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. It\u2019s been an amazing experience for me because I have very little money invested so far. I thought by this time I\u2019d have about 30 million in ads and I have none although I took a small radio commercial the other day in Iowa. But we have virtually no money in invested in ads or advertising. And I think you as business people will feel pretty good about this and respect it. At first, I was embarassed by that. I said, \u201cYou know, I think we\u2019re going to have spend money just to spend money\u201d but it\u2019s not really like a good thing to do because I am in first place by a lot. It\u2019s not even close. Every single poll, every single state. The numbers just came in three minutes ago in New Hampshire \u2013 the PPP poll \u2013 Trump at 27%, the next one is 13%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 5%, and the rest are off the board. They have to drop out pretty soon I guess, right? Most of importantly, favorability \u2013 no, I still like the top number the most but favorability is now at 50% to 39%, which is good, and I beat Hillary in the Fox poll as you see very easily 46% to 41%. That\u2019s ultimately the most important. And you know, I\u2019ve been a tremendous fan and I\u2019ve been a tremendous contributor. I\u2019ve given a lot of money recently to Hatzalah, $100,000, emergency response. They do a fantastic job. And my father, Fred, was always a big supporter. So I grew up in that environment. I grew up in Brooklyn, Queens, and Israel was always very paramount in our mind. In fact, I\u2019ve been sometimes criticized because I received so many awards from Jewish groups, and they look at my wall. It\u2019s loaded up. But now the Christians are catching up, I have to tell you. My Christians are liking me a lot lately and they\u2019ve been great. They have been great. So, Obama is the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to Israel. The worst. The worst. And when I see great friends of mine who are very, very pro-Israel, very \u2013 I mean, they love Israel. They love it with passion, and they\u2019re having fundraisers for Obama. I said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d And it\u2019s almost like they answer me and they say, \u201cWe don\u2019t know. He comes to New York. We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know.\u201d I said he\u2019s a disaster. I really believe the Iran deal. Look, I\u2019m a negotiator like you folks. We\u2019re negotiators. We don\u2019t build gas stations in the middle of, as you know, Afghanistan for $43 million \u2013 can you imagine this? A small gas station \u2013 $43 million \u2013 and then they used the wrong kind of terminal because they don\u2019t sell that type of gas. Okay? $43 million for a gas station. How many think they could have done it for less? Would you raise your hands please? But I look at Obama, I look at that deal where we gave to Iran $150 billion. They don\u2019t need to develop nuclear weapons; they can buy them. They can buy them. It\u2019s true. Why do they have to develop them? They can buy them. We gave them $150 billion. They go out and in terms of, you know, surveillance, they have the right to self-inspect. How about that? On their major, most dangerous they can self-inspect.

We need somebody with tremendous energy to straighten out the military, to straighten out ISIS, to straighten out our horrible trade deals, to terminate Obamacare and come up with something far better for far less money. You need somebody with tremendous personal energy as President. We have a president right now that doesn\u2019t have energy. I mean, you think Obama has energy? He has no energy. And he\u2019s been a horrible president. We need somebody with great personal energy as a leader so that we can make great deals with other countries and do well in every other respect.

Nobody else is going to be able to do that. I\u2019m going to do it. I\u2019m going to make it in my opinion better than ever before, and I think that\u2019s awfully tough to compete with. And one of the reasons that in my book I actually put financials in there \u2013 I showed some of the developments that \u2013 I have many, many more because you can only \u2013 Simon and Schuster \u2013 you actually kept me to eight or nine pages. Right? And there are four or five in a page. But I show some of the great developments that I have done that are so successful and so incredible and so financially good, I show my financial statement from a year and a half, two years ago. Now it\u2019s even better but we didn\u2019t have that certified yet. So I do that not in a braggadocious way. I do that because that\u2019s the kind of thinking our country needs right now. We are run by people that are incompetent. We are run by people who in so many words \u2013 I hate to use the word stupid but you have to use that word. Unless they have bad intentions which I don\u2019t believe they do. But we are run by incompetent people. We have incompetent leadership. There are so many things. Like I mentioned corporate inversion. The Democrats want the money to come back. Who doesn\u2019t? The Republicans want the money to come back. For three years, the Democrats have said we want the money to come back. For three years, the Democrats and the Republicans agree 100%. You have a vast majority. Maybe everybody. For three years. Guess what? They haven\u2019t done anything. Right? They can\u2019t even get along when they agree. So here\u2019s the thing where we can take trillions of dollars, bring it back to this country, rebuild big parts of our country with it, companies can spend that money in our country, we have everybody agrees it should be done for years and they can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s a part of the problem. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n You see, they were asking \u2013 they were giving statements in a sarcastic, disgusting way. And by the way, I think Becky is terrific and I think Carl is terrific. But I think John Harwood is not very good at what he does. But I think Becky Quick is a terrific person. I think Carl is a terrific person. But I will tell you John Harwood was a disgrace to CNBC. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And one of the problems that we have is our currency right now is not competitive with other currencies. Because if you look at the devaluations of China, of Japan, of many, many different countries, they\u2019re making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we don\u2019t have leaders that know how to say to China, \u201cDon\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t do that. Because if you do that, we\u2019re going to put a big fat tax on you. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d And you know what? If you said that, they wouldn\u2019t do it. If you have the right messenger\u2026 Question:\n[Inaudible]\n But the election that I\u2019m watching is the election for the presidency of the United States. That is going to be in my opinion this will be truly one of the most important elections we\u2019ve ever had in this country. We\u2019re so far behind. And we cannot go another four years with incompetent leadership. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n What happened is they sent this incredible photographer up to do a book cover, do to a picture. And he did some great\u2026photos. I\u2019m smiling. I\u2019m happy. I look good. Everything was fine. And then he took one where I wasn\u2019t like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a nasty picture. And then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture I had was that one. It\u2019s a terrible, horrible, nasty picture. But when you\u2019re talking about \u201cCrippled America\u201d and you\u2019re talking about all of the problems we have, I can\u2019t have a big smiley face up there. So that\u2019s how we picked it. We picked the worst photo taken of me. I would have loved to have a beautiful smiling picture but somehow that doesn\u2019t go with the title of the book or frankly the content of the book, and actually Simon and Schuster agreed with me.

I\u2019m saying what about corporate inversions? $2.5 trillion at least. I think it\u2019s probably twice that number is in other countries wanting to come back and because our system is so corrupt and terrible, they can\u2019t get the money back to invest in this country.

Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Well, you know, you have to understand, I was a developer. A lot of people didn\u2019t care about my view in 2003 and 2004. But there was a Reuters article taken from a magazine about my stance in 2004, I believe, in July of 2004 and it talked about my stance on how I felt about Iraq. And I said very strongly exactly what happened. I said you will destabilize the Middle East and when you destabilize the Middle East, Iran will take over Iraq. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. And they will take over the oil reserves, which are among the largest in the world, and in addition other bad things will happen. The other bad things are ISIS. I said that in 2004 and that was an article that was taken from a magazine which was previous to that. I\u2019ve felt that for a long time.

That was before Trump was going to happen. Right? But he was favored for a period of time. Favored. Walker. Gov. Walker. They thought he was going to win. What happened is he got out. I think the way he got out was great. I think he did a really smart thing for himself.

So somebody said, \u201cHow did they get there?\u201d And actually Variety and Hollywood Reporter, who do report this stuff pretty well \u2013 much better than the political press \u2013 they said \u201csolely for one reason \u2013 it was Trump\u201d. I\u2019ll take the credit. But I\u2019ll tell you what I also want. I think that Wounded Warriors and our veterans should be given some of the enormous profits being made on these debates \u2013 enormous profits \u2013 by the way beyond anything they\u2019ve ever envisioned. CNN was going to get $2,000 for a 30 second ad. They ended up getting $250,000. So they went from $2,000 to $250,000 for a 30 second ad. The networks and the cable are making a fortune, and I think they should give some of the profits to the Wounded Warriors and the veterans. That\u2019s what I want. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n I have many, many executives upstairs and in different buildings that I have that are women. Many \u2013 a proportion that\u2019s close to 50%. Might even be over 50% if I analyze it. And they get paid a lot of money \u2013 in many cases more than men doing the same job. So women have always appreciated that about me. I\u2019ve been in terms of employment really a standout and I\u2019ve been honored for doing so well with women. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n \u2026Because the country is doing so poorly. It\u2019s a very accurate title because the country is doing so poorly.

They\u2019ve been forming since last night and I\u2019m going to be signing books starting at 12 p.m. We\u2019re doing a couple of interviews and then we\u2019re signing books starting at 12 p.m. and that\u2019ll be very exciting for me. But we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re doing this but they do it. They find a way. So I\u2019m looking forward to getting to the signings. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n A poll just came out in Florida where I\u2019m leading big. Georgia, Texas. I mean, all over the place. And I think you know look we\u2019re doing well. And if you add Ben and myself we\u2019re beating everybody by a lot. That seems to be the big story that we\u2019re beating \u2013 they call it the establishment. It\u2019s called really the failed establishment because the establishment has let us down. But I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how his book is doing. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Look, nobody can negotiate trade deals like me. We are going to take the $400 billion a year that we\u2019re losing with China, that\u2019s going to be turned around. The $75 billion a year that we\u2019re short on with Japan. The $50 billion a year that we lost to Mexico. And that\u2019s right, there will be a wall built. It will go up. It will be built. And people will come into the country legally. So I mean, much different than \u2013 you\u2019re look at Marco Rubio \u2013 very, very weak on illegal immigration. You look at Ben and he\u2019s very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of Medicare. I mean, Ben wants to get rid of Medicare. You can\u2019t get rid of Medicare. It\u2019d be a horrible thing to get rid of. It actually works. You get rid of the fraud, waste, and abuse. It works. So when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of Medicare, I don\u2019t know how he stays here. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n But Marco is a sitting Senator and he doesn\u2019t show up for the people of Florida, and I don\u2019t think he should be doing that. Now, Bush gave a very weak message. I agree with that. It was poorly delivered. But the facts are on Bush\u2019s side and ultimately I think Marco\u2019s going to be hurt very badly. And if you look at Mr. Singer, you have to see where Mr. Singer is coming from and when you see where he\u2019s coming from, I think people are going to say, \u201cWhoa, we didn\u2019t know that.\u201d But look at Marco\u2019s stance on illegal immigration. It\u2019s really trouble for him. I don\u2019t see how he can win.

I want to thank Simon and Schuster, one of the most magnificent publishers. For years and years, I\u2019ve heard about Simon and Schuster\u2019s being a fabulous \u2013 I was going to say the Rolls-Royce, I was going to say the Harvard or the Yale, but they really are a great one. And I want to thank you very much. You\u2019ve given us such tremendous support. And we did this quickly and I think we did it very effectively. It\u2019s been an incredible experience. We wrote a book and the title \u2013 \u201cCrippled America\u201d \u2013 is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and I think one of the reasons we\u2019ve been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is. We tell the truth. And America is crippled. We owe $17 [trillion] and now $18 [trillion] and now it\u2019s actually very soon going to be $19 trillion in debt. We have a military that doesn\u2019t have proper instruction from leadership. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re losing all over the world with trade deals.

It\u2019s impossible to go on like this any longer. I always mention as an example Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor. We get Sergeant Bergdahl; they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly. And that\u2019s not the way it\u2019s going to work anymore. So we write about it in the book. We tell lots of different stories of lots of different things. And I think it\u2019s going to be very instructional, very important. To me, it was instructional. When I did \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d, I think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely instructional. Even today when I speak, so many people hold up the book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d and the other books we\u2019ve done. So this is one that probably not since the Art of the Deal, I have to tell this to Louise and Simon and Schuster, have I worked so hard on a book and it was in a confined period of time. We wanted to get it out really, really quickly so that it pertain to what\u2019s going on right now. It\u2019s a moment of time. And we got it done. And David did a fantastic job\u2026And all of my people did a great job. They helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now. So this was not easy getting this in.

And yet, people pour right through into us, into us. They call us the dumb Americans. That\u2019s what they call us because of our leaders. They call us the dumb Americans.

I\u2019m impressed actually. Because to a certain extent, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. But if you want to become a citizen of Mexico, it\u2019s impossible.

And a simple act of Congress gets rid of it. And a lot of people didn\u2019t know that. Okay? And the reason I said it can be possible because nobody could be foolish enough to allow a thing like that. How could it be possible? And we\u2019re one of the only countries where that takes place. And honestly, I use Mexico as an example because they\u2019re so tough. If that happens in Mexico, they don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about. What are you talking about? But with us?

We have tremendous illegal immigration problems. Dwight Eisenhower, nice guy, he moved 1.5 million people out of the United States. And you know what happened?

And we\u2019ll try to get them back real soon and we\u2019ll do it through a legal process. But we also have some really bad gang members. You know, some of the gangs in LA.

I don\u2019t know who they are or where they are but you do. Probably mostly back there in the press. But the police do an unbelievable job. And they know the gangs. You go to LA the LA cops. You got Chicago, the Chicago cops. These people are amazing people if they would be allowed to do their jobs. But they\u2019re not allowed to do their jobs.

And I don\u2019t want to put these really bad dudes \u2013 I mean, they are bad \u2013 I don\u2019t want to have to pay for them for the next 45 years. Okay?

I got to know them a couple of months ago when I went down to Texas to the border. They\u2019re great people. They\u2019re not allowed to do their job. They stand there and watch people walk right in front of them smiling at them. They want to do their job; they\u2019re not allowed to. So the executive order that President Obama signed, the one good thing about an executive order, in the first minute in office, I will counter-sign and revoke those executive orders. They\u2019ll be revoked. The only good thing. It\u2019s actually the only good thing about an executive order is that a new president can just do a signature and that\u2019s the end of that.

But with that being said, I may want to make a better deal because you know what? We\u2019re bringing oil from Canada. Right? I may say, I want 10%. We\u2019re going to approve it but I want 10%, 15%. Because the truth is that the Keystone Pipeline was better a while ago than it is now because we have so much because of new technology, we have so much energy underneath our own feet with the fracking and all of the other things that have emerged over the last five years, we have so much energy. And it\u2019s great stuff. We have really great quality, higher than Canada. You know, they have the tar sands, which is a problem for them. Very expensive to get it out. We have great stuff. So I would approve it because I love the jobs of building it. I love the jobs of building it. But I may just say, maybe we should get 10%, 15%, maybe 20% as that oil flows through our land. You know, maybe we should do that. So I\u2019m going to look into that. But when I approve it \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what, when I approve it, it\u2019ll be a great deal for the United States.

All of a sudden they\u2019re working part-time because of Obamacare because from an accounting standpoint, it just works better. They love the owners, the stores and things. They love the owners; they think the owners are great. But the owners are forced to make part-time jobs; they have part-time jobs. They work all their life. They have a wonderful company that they\u2019re working for, and now all of a sudden they\u2019re cut into part-time jobs because of Obamacare because of the rulings of Obamacare.

You go to the SCC.\u201d I said I can\u2019t do that because I have such an unbelievable relationship with the people from Iowa that I think we\u2019re going to win. I really do. I believe it. I believe it. And I don\u2019t want to skip Iowa. I think we\u2019re going to do well. I think we\u2019re going to do great with evangelicals. I think a lot of things are going to come out over the next period of time that are not going to be so good for our opponents, honestly, and I think I\u2019m going to do great with the evangelicals because I am the real deal. I will tell you that. I\u2019m the real deal. So I told these political pros, you know, I hate to say it but the last long number of elections on the Republican circuit, the person that won Iowa did not get the nomination. Okay? I want to take away some of your muster. You understand that. So could we do \u2013 and please do me a favor? Let me win Iowa. And then I\u2019m going to win, I\u2019m telling you we\u2019re going to win New Hampshire, and we\u2019re going to win South Carolina. A great poll just came out on North Carolina just a little while. A PPP poll. It was great. Some of you saw that. But great poll. But we\u2019re going to go on and we\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win. And actually, one of the pundits \u2013 because you have some smart pundits and some very, very dumb pundits. A lot of pundits said \u201cHe\u2019ll never run. He\u2019s not going to run.\u201d They\u2019re still trying to recover. But one of the very smart one says \u201cIf Trump wins Iowa, it\u2019s over.\u201d It\u2019s interesting because it will go right through because everywhere else is so great. And I thought it was good here. Come on. Okay, so that\u2019s the end of that. But I want to tell you, will you \u2013 I refuse to say \u201cGet your asses in gear.\u201d I will not say that. I will not say it. I will not say it because I don\u2019t want to use anything that\u2019s even a little bit off. So will you please do me a favor and work with my people and go out on Feb. 1stand vote and give us a victory? And if I win Iowa, we\u2019re going to run the whole table and we are going to make such great deals and we\u2019re going to have such a great military and we\u2019re going to take care of our health care without that crazy Obamacare that\u2019s a nightmare. So, I\u2019m sticking with you people. I\u2019m going to spend money here. I have a great team over here. And I will tell you I\u2019m going to spend a lot of time here and I really want to win Iowa and I think we should and it\u2019s so important. And you know, it\u2019s about time that Iowa could have a victory and let that person go onto a total victory. Okay? Not like over the last \u2013 right? So, I love you all. I mean, we\u2019re having fun. But I love you all. But I do mean it. I\u2019m going to stay here. We\u2019re going to work really hard. When I heard the poll today, they said \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to work harder in Iowa.\u201d I\u2019m not leaving Iowa. I\u2019m not leaving Iowa. Now, if I lose Iowa, I will never speak to you people again. That I can tell you. Okay, let\u2019s do a couple of questions. Right? Come on. ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in Sioux City, Iowa \u2013 Part 10"}, {"text": "And what happened and I haven\u2019t talked about this before but I\u2019m seeing what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s horrible what\u2019s going on. What happened is the last time they had the Super PACs, I actually think there was sort of a wall. You know, they called it the wall. And this is a wall too. Won\u2019t be as good as the one I\u2019m going to build but it\u2019s a wall. But it was a wall and they didn\u2019t deal. I mean, even though like Bush has a friend of his running his Super PAC, I\u2019m sure they never talk. I\u2019m sure. What do you think the chances are that they talk? 100% or 99%? 100%. I\u2019d say 100%. I\u2019d say 100%. Only a foolish person would say 99%. But whatever. They\u2019re not supposed to. But they put a friend in there. They put other people in there. They put whoever. And that\u2019s the way it works. And in some cases, I hear in Ben\u2019s case, I hear in other cases, they\u2019re literally running. I mean, had Walker done this in all fairness because he had money in the Super PAC but he had no money in his campaign and he was unable to figure out this is what they\u2019re all doing. That\u2019s why he\u2019s out of the race because he couldn\u2019t figure it out. The whole thing with Super PACs is a horrible, horrible scam. So I sent letters last week to as many as we could find. They\u2019re all over the place. We want you to close the Super PAC. We want nothing to do with it. We don\u2019t want to get advertisements. We don\u2019t want any of the money. Go home and ideally give the money back. They don\u2019t even have to give the money back from what I understand. They can keep it. They\u2019ll probably if they actually raised money for me, they\u2019ll say \u201cWhat a horrible thing he just said. I think we\u2019re going to support somebody else.\u201d They could do that. But the Super PACs have total control over the people running for office. Total. Nothing over me. Nothing. I feel it\u2019s very unfair. I feel it\u2019s a very unfair situation. Now, if they want, they could have full disclosure and everything\u2026But what are they doing with this whole thing? And I think it makes dishonest people out of people that might be honest. But the Super PACs are controlling your candidates \u2013 some more than others. Some are unbelievable. And what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left. When you read that Ben raised $1, how much is left after he pays all of the consultants and all of these people, how much is left to spend in the campaign. You\u2019ll be amazed. I mean, it\u2019s so little. Bush, it\u2019s the same thing. And I\u2019ll go over \u2013 there are other names. I know every one of them. But it\u2019s a horrible thing that\u2019s taking place. And again, last cycle, at least they went through the motions. Now, they\u2019re not even going through the motions. They\u2019re not even going through. And just remember when I have to negotiate with companies to keep them in this country so they build jobs here and they build their plants here and their factories here and they do all of the things here, when I have to do that, you know, John Deere, I paid them tens of millions of dollars. You can even check. I said to John Deere, \u201cI want an endorsement.\u201d I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll give me an endorsement. I\u2019ll tell you if they don\u2019t they\u2019re not so smart. I guarantee no other person gave John Deere \u2013 I mean, I bought probably more than $10 million worth of John Deere equipments. I love it. You know why? Iowa. Iowa. I love it. I love it. When we can. By the way, it\u2019s a great company. It\u2019s a great company. But I buy a lot of stuff from John Deere because I have a lot of big developments that really require John Deere type equipment. I don\u2019t have to buy it from them. I could buy it from others. But I want to steer it to them when I can. But we have to do something to clean up this political mess because it\u2019s crooked stuff. It\u2019s crooked stuff. And it\u2019s got to stop. And it\u2019s very unfair to people who go out and do it the way you\u2019re supposed to do it, including me. I think I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s self-funding. I\u2019m the only one putting up my own money, other than \u2013 I know it\u2019s precious \u2013 people write in to DonaldJTrump.com or whatever and they send me checks like $20. I keep saying the woman for $7.50, $50, $100. I don\u2019t want their money. But if you send it back it\u2019s totally insulting. I mean, they always write letters too. They write these beautiful letters \u2013 \u201cMr. Trump, I can\u2019t afford much and I know you don\u2019t need it but I\u2019m sending $50 because that\u2019s so important what you\u2019re saying about the country.\u201d It\u2019s beautiful. I mean, I\u2019ve seen such beautiful letters. And if I send it back, there\u2019s no letter I can write that\u2019s not going to be insulting to those people, really. \u201cDear Mr. So and So or Mrs. So and So, I don\u2019t need your money and thanks a lot but we\u2019re going to do it ourselves.\u201d If I got that back, I\u2019d say \u201cWho the hell does he think he is?\u201d ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in Sioux City, Iowa \u2013 Part 9"}, {"text": "So I only say this and you know what? People might say \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. He\u2019s a terrible person, a terrible human being. But I\u2019m going to vote for him anyways.\u201d Okay, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m actually a nice person. I always say this \u2013 nobody can do this stuff better than me. And I know all the guys I\u2019m running against. They\u2019re wonderful people. Some of them I really like. But who cares? I was talking to one of the candidates the other day. I was talking about corporate inversions and they didn\u2019t even know what the hell I was talking. They had no idea. It\u2019s not their thing. And unless we stop all of the things that are going with other countries and unless we make great trade deals, we\u2019re being eaten alive. That\u2019s why when you look at the phony numbers, we have 100 million people in our workforce that aren\u2019t working. Our real unemployment rate is probably 30%. It\u2019s not 5.3%. That was done for politicians so they\u2019d look good. It\u2019s not 5.3%. How can you have 5.3% when you have 100 million people? You look for a job. If you\u2019re a young guy, that handsome young guy with the red hair, right there\u2026but if he comes out and he goes into the workforce and he looks for a job and he goes through college and does well and then he can\u2019t get a job and when he gives up because at some point after months you give up, they essentially consider you employed. It\u2019s the most ridiculous thing. We have a tremendous \u2013 tens of millions of people in that position. They can\u2019t find jobs. They\u2019re good people. They want to work. They can\u2019t. But it\u2019s not reflected in the real numbers because the politicians want to look good. So let me just before we talk some questions, I\u2019m going to talk about something I\u2019ve never really talked about it onstage but we should talk about it. It\u2019s called Super PACs. It\u2019s one of the great scams of all time. It\u2019s one of the great scams. So we sent out \u2013 I think I had \u2013 and it\u2019s not me. People set them up. And I don\u2019t know. Maybe they\u2019re setting up for my benefit. Let\u2019s take me. A guy sees me, likes me, sets up a Super PAC. I don\u2019t talk to him. I don\u2019t do anything. I think we had either 9 or 5 or 11. We don\u2019t even know. They\u2019re all over the place. Trump, Trump \u2013 one of them called The Art of the Deal PAC after the book. They have all these PACs. And the money comes in. And what do they do with the money? I don\u2019t know. And we aren\u2019t supposed to call them or anything. Okay. So, we wrote a letter \u2013 a legal letter \u2013 to I think either 9 or 11 last week saying we don\u2019t want their money, send it back because again, what do they do with it? If some guy that\u2019s having a hard time all of a sudden has $2 million sitting in a Super PAC, do you think he\u2019s going to take ads for Trump? Maybe and maybe not. So we sent them a \u2013 it\u2019s a scam, Super PACs, a scam. It\u2019s a disgrace that we have. A disgrace. And I\u2019ll tell you I read a number with, as an example, with Ben. Ben is paying 70 to almost 80 cents on the dollar to raise money. So when you read he has all this money, he\u2019s paying a lot of money and that\u2019s not reflected yet. So when you hear they raised $20 million, they\u2019re paying \u2013 now think of it, who pays \u2013 the number I actually heard was 79 but you know these guys will check them so I\u2019m telling you it may be off but you all know it\u2019s a lot. I think they said, 79 cents on the dollar. Think of it. To raise the money, they take 79 cents before they get to use the money for what it was supposed to be. Somebody is making a fortune. I know in Romney\u2019s campaign, a couple of guys walked away with millions and millions of dollars. Millions. They became rich raising money. It\u2019s better than being a real estate broker. For the people and real estate brokers, they take these massive percentages of the money they raise. It\u2019s a scam. It\u2019s a scam. Now, in Ben\u2019s case, his Super PAC is running Iowa. And let me tell you, the people that are running that Super PAC, even if it comes in small donations, those are the real bosses. Those are the bosses. In the case of Jeb Bush, you\u2019re not supposed to deal with these Super PACs. Okay? So, it was in the Wall Street Journal the other day. He has a Super PAC fundraiser or something in a hotel and right next to it, he had his campaign ballroom. Did you read that? Two ballrooms. One here, one here, right next to each other by coincidence, of course. They\u2019re not supposed to be coordination. They\u2019re not supposed to be talking. They\u2019re right next to each other. And that\u2019s nothing compared to what some are doing. It\u2019s a scam and it should be stopped. And it\u2019s unfair to somebody like me that is spending my own money.

First of all, I am a great Christian and I am. I am. Remember that. And I do well with the evangelicals. But the evangelicals left me down a little bit just last month. I don\u2019t know what I did. But I am a great Christian. I\u2019m a believer and I believe in the Bible. And I even brought my Bible a month ago to a group signed by my mother, Mary, and with the address and the date \u2013 I won\u2019t tell you what date it was because possibly you\u2019d think I\u2019m younger than that. But she didn\u2019t want anybody taking my Bible because that was very important to her. So cute. She has the address, has the date.

When are we going to come back, \u201cWe beat Japan\u201d? Do you know that everybody said \u201cOh, Japan. They have so power over us.

They said, \u201cLet\u2019s wait.\u201d Now we leave because of a lack of leadership. We leave and boom it comes apart. That\u2019s what happened. That was the surge. Everybody talk so much \u2013 \u201cOh, the surge was so great.\u201d The surge was great because everybody knew \u2013 they knew what was happening. They knew it was going to happen. They knew we were leaving even through Bush. I mean, honestly, they knew we were leaving. They were fed up. So they pulled back and they said, \u201cLet\u2019s get them out.\u201d Everybody wanted to leave. Now, I would have done it differently. Even if I wanted to leave and I might or I might not.

And whenever I order them, they all come from South Korea. They make all the television \u2013 other than Sony but Sony has sort of lost its way a little bit. Sony is Japan. But South Korea \u2013 LG, Samsung. I don\u2019t get bids from American. I\u2019d love to. I\u2019d love to. George Will said there\u2019s a company in South Carolina that makes television. I said where are they? I\u2019d like to have a good name too by the way. It\u2019s important. You know, when somebody\u2019s paying you a fortune for a hotel room, it\u2019s nice to see a good name. Right? Do we agree? Well, it\u2019s a company in South Carolina but they don\u2019t make them there; they assemble them. They\u2019ll order parts that come in and they\u2019ll assemble them. But much different. But I\u2019d love it if we made them. But you take South Korea. We defend South Korea for essentially nothing. You have the maniac over in North Korea that nobody ever talks about by the way. Now, he really has nuclear weapons and we don\u2019t talk about him. We made the worst deal ever made with Iran. Right? The worst. These are the people that represent \u2013 these people are incompetent. Or stupid. Somebody said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say stupid. It\u2019s not nice.\u201d But it\u2019s true. They\u2019re stupid. I think. I mean, I think. Unless I don\u2019t know is there something going on that we don\u2019t know about? Think of it. Point after point, we lost. We lost everything. We\u2019ve given them $150 billion. Hard to believe. They don\u2019t have to develop \u2013 I was telling somebody they don\u2019t have to develop nuclear weapon; they can buy it. What the hell why should they develop it? They can buy it. And now all of a sudden they\u2019re going into Syria. They got so much money. They\u2019re a terrorist state. They\u2019re going into all of these different places. We\u2019re fighting them in Yemen and yet we\u2019re making a deal with them. So why don\u2019t you say \u201cHey, Yemen out\u201d? Our prisoners \u2013 I want them back. I want them back. I don\u2019t want them over there. I want them back. And all we have to do, very simple, is if you have the right messenger. I\u2019m the right messenger. You know, I\u2019ve gotten to a point where I have to be braggadocious. It\u2019s terrible. Right? Because I can\u2019t be so nice and say \u201cWe can all do a wonderful job\u201d. People can\u2019t do those kind of stuff. For instance, the wall. I said, I guarantee you that we\u2019re going to build a wall. It\u2019s going to be a real wall. We\u2019re going to have people come through and they\u2019re going to come through legally. Or they\u2019re going to come through with visas, which is a safe way, if we need it. And we want people to come through. I want people to come through. I don\u2019t want to say no. But we have at least 11 million \u2013 you know, the scary thing is nobody has any idea how many. You know, we\u2019ve been hearing that number for years. You know, like 11 million. We have no idea. I spoke to one of the top people. They have no idea. Might be 5 million. Might also be 32 million. Could be 50 [million]\u2026 But we have to get them out. We have to \u2013 look, it\u2019s harsh.

That\u2019s what they\u2019re good at. They get re-elected. And they make promises and they\u2019re all talk and they\u2019re no action. And the same things happen with these politicians. It\u2019s always the same. So we have so many different things and what I\u2019ve done with our tax plan, which something I\u2019m very proud of, we\u2019ve brought it down to a few groups. Because right now, you have to go out \u2013 people who aren\u2019t doing well go out and hire companies to help them with their tax plans. They\u2019ll pay $500, $1,000 because it\u2019s so complicated. And we\u2019re going to make it nice and simple.

Somebody said \u201cOh, why isn\u2019t everybody paying?\u201d You know, 40% \u2013 a big percentage \u2013 will not pay any tax at all. People that are doing badly. They said \u2013 well, I won\u2019t use the candidates\u2019 name because I don\u2019t want to insult any candidate when they can\u2019t defend themselves. They said \u201cWe want everybody to pay at least something.\u201d And I said, \u201cI agree.\u201d Here\u2019s the problem. From the standpoint of bookkeeping, from the standpoint of bureaucracy, you\u2019re talking about millions and millions of returns. You\u2019re talking about building the IRS even bigger and it\u2019s a monster. And I could cut it down way down. And the money that you\u2019re talking about is far less than the administrative costs. So I said, \u201cI agree. Except for one thing from a practical standpoint, it\u2019s too much. Most of these people aren\u2019t paying anyway.\u201d What I want to do is bring our jobs back from China, bring our jobs back from Mexico, bring fairness to our deals as an example with Japan. I was in Los Angeles. Ships \u2013 the biggest ships you\u2019ve ever seen. Cars are pouring off into this country. Made in Japan. We give them practically nothing. The balance is so bad. The imbalance is so bad. And then we have all the strikes. See, what our people don\u2019t know and only somebody that wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d or does this stuff. It\u2019s natural. It\u2019s like a great athlete. Like a Jack Nicklaus. He was always able to sink that putt. Right? You know, he\u2019s just better. And you have athletes \u2013 very few \u2013 but there are some people that have a certain ability. A lot of people don\u2019t even know we have all the power. We have all the power in China. You know, we owe right now China and Japan equally $1.5 \u2013 think of this \u2013 trillion. $1.5 trillion. Think of this. They take our business and in the case of Japan, mostly cars. But they take our business. They take our jobs. Factories close down all over the place. And we owe them money. Right? It\u2019s a magic act. For them not for us. For us it\u2019s a horror show. It\u2019s going to end. It\u2019s going to end. And people like Carl Icahn and the people like the best negotiators \u2013 I know the best negotiators in the world. Some I think are horrible people. I\u2019ll be honest with you. I don\u2019t care. Do you care if they\u2019re horrible people? Who cares? Now, Carl happens to be actually a very nice guy but he\u2019s a brilliant negotiator and a tough cookie and he\u2019s built a fortune. He doesn\u2019t want money. He doesn\u2019t want to say, \u201cOh, give me $200,000 a year in government money.\u201d He wants to do it. He\u2019s proud to do it. He wants to help the country. And it\u2019s so easy for him. For instance, if I say \u201cCarl, do me a favor. The trade deal we have with China is so unfair we\u2019re losing $400 billion a year. Carl, do me a favor. Make it fair.\u201d I don\u2019t have to give him a big speech. I don\u2019t have to give him a big speech. I mean, I can tell you that within a very, very short period of time, things will straighten out. I mean, things will straighten out and it\u2019s going to be our benefit. But think of it, if we\u2019re losing that kind of money \u2013 that imbalance. It\u2019s an imbalance. Some people will say \u201cThat\u2019s not really a loss.\u201d It is a loss. If we have that kind of imbalance and suppose you brought it back to zero or even if we lost $100 billion a year, that\u2019s a lot of money. Believe me, I couldn\u2019t sleep.

He\u2019s one of the great traders, one of the great dealmakers. He says Trump, Trump. And he\u2019s not somebody that just do it. He wants somebody that knows what they\u2019re doing. He understand. You talk about corporate inversions and all of the things that have been going on. Corporate inversions. You know, many of the companies in this country have trillions of dollars cumulatively. They think $2.5 trillion overseas right now. They can\u2019t get it in. And everybody agrees that we should bring it in. The Democrats and the Republicans. They\u2019ve agreed for years. They can\u2019t make a deal because they have no leader. It\u2019s not like \u201cOh gee, we disagree on Obamacare. Or we disagree on something else.\u201d Although I must tell you many of the Democrats that I speak to because I\u2019m friendly with all of them. I\u2019m friendly with like Republicans. I get a long with everybody. You know, everybody says \u201cOh, you won\u2019t be a unifier\u201d. I\u2019ll be the greatest unifier of all. Why is Obama a unifier? But I will tell you many of the Democrats who voted for Obamacare would never have done it now and were lied to 28 times. Right? \u201cYou can keep your doctor, keep your plan, keep your this, everything\u2019s going to be great.\u201d Turned out to be a total lie. 28 different times that they know of and they wouldn\u2019t have done it. But when you look at what\u2019s happening with corporations and the highest tax \u2013 we pay the highest tax anywhere in the world of any country \u2013 but they have trillions of dollars overseas. And these are great companies in many cases. They have thousands of employees. They can\u2019t get their money back. And the reason is bureaucracy. It\u2019s very hard. And also big reason the tax is too high. They don\u2019t want to bring $1 million back and pay $300,000 or $350,000 tax. They\u2019d rather leave it over there. And if they bring it back, they\u2019ll be using it to invest in our country. I mean, a lot of good things will happen. I happen to believe it\u2019s more than $2.5 trillion. But here\u2019s the thing and I use it because it\u2019s so incredible. Here\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s not controversial. It\u2019s not like you have the Republicans here and you have \u2013 everybody agrees. They\u2019ve agreed you know that for 2.5, 3 years. They can\u2019t make a deal. And now what\u2019s happening and this will be the next great story is companies are leaving the United States \u2013 two reasons \u2013 lower taxes but also to get their money. They\u2019ve got billions of dollars overseas. They\u2019re leaving our country in order to get their money and in order to pay lower tax. And you\u2019re talking about one company I know of \u2013 I don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ve written about it \u2013 but you\u2019re talking about 6,000 jobs just one company. You\u2019re talking about potentially thousands of companies. And I say it, in the old days, they\u2019d leave New York. People would move down and companies would move down to Florida or they\u2019d move to Texas or they\u2019d leave New Jersey, where taxes are quite high, and they\u2019d move to another location. Right? Now, they leave our country and they go to other countries. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened. In the world of the Internet and the world of very fast jets, it\u2019s a different world out there. And there\u2019s no loyalty. They\u2019re paid a lot of money to make a lot of money for their shareholders and some of them are actually foreign; they\u2019d like to move back to these countries. They bring in executives that are from Ireland, from other places. And they don\u2019t mind. They don\u2019t have loyalty to the United States. So my plan, my tax plan, is something I\u2019m very proud of. We\u2019re going to solve corporate inversion. I\u2019ll tell you what, we will have that money back \u2013 if I get elected president, that money will be back so fast your head will spin. Nobody else will be able to do it. Nobody.

I love doing it. I may never even see it. I mean, I own some of the great properties in the world. Doral in Miami.

Now at some point some of these guys have to leave. Don\u2019t we agree? It\u2019s getting ridiculous. Because like tomorrow night we\u2019re having a debate, and I wish we had more time for the debate. Not in terms of three hours because who wants three hours? You know, I could stand up for 20 hours if I had to but who wants to watch that long? Hillary\u2019s debate essentially lasted for an hour and a half and I was \u2013 oh \u2013 it was \u2013 you couldn\u2019t watch it. You have Hillary against a socialist/communist. And honestly, he\u2019s not going to win. Just so you understand\u2026He\u2019s not going to win and neither is she\u2026 Well, she\u2019s being totally protected because in theory she shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to run. She\u2019s being protected. It\u2019s a tough game and it\u2019s a nasty game but she\u2019s being totally protected. But she\u2019s going to beat him and you still have one more of these guys. O\u2019Malley. So he\u2019ll be out quickly, I guess. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s he doing. What do they do when they have zero? They have zero. And I wouldn\u2019t say it against our folks. But they\u2019ve treated me \u2013 some of the zeroes have treated me so nastily, right? Because they want to start controversy and they want to try pick up some points. And you know what? I\u2019m not going to even mention names. Usually I do. I love doing it. But everybody that\u2019s hit me so far has gone down. They\u2019ve gone down. And they\u2019ve gone down bigly. And a couple of the ones and zeroes \u2013 they\u2019re the ones that hit the hardest. I mean, they\u2019re like desperate people. But they hit. One of them has a zero with an arrow pointing to the left. That means less than zero. And I don\u2019t understand. What does it mean? I assume it\u2019s a typo but maybe not. But when you look at the things that are happening with our country \u2013 the trade situation with not just China \u2013 I talk about China all the time because that\u2019s the main abuser, that\u2019s the biggest abuser. The numbers are astronomical. Almost $400 billion a year in terms of imbalance. Think of it \u2013 $400 billion a year. And they send stuff over here but we can\u2019t send stuff over there. They tax us. Big tax. A friend of mine can\u2019t get stuff over there. The tax is so big. Big tax. Somebody bought an airplane in China here. Can\u2019t get it over there. Spoiled guy. Rich guy. Bought a beautiful plane. Can\u2019t get it over there because the tax is so massive that he\u2019s now selling in this country because China won\u2019t let him have the plane and he has to pay a tax. I won\u2019t even tell you what the tax is. It\u2019s so astronomical that I don\u2019t even believe them myself. So I\u2019m not going to say it because those guys will say \u201cWell, he was wrong.\u201d All I can tell you is it\u2019s a massive tax. Like you don\u2019t buy planes here because if you do, you won\u2019t be able to get them back in. And here, we accept all of their products. So we have almost a $400 billion trade imbalance with China. We have a $70 billion trade imbalance with Japan. We have a \u2013 you know, with all that\u2019s going on in the South China Sea and you look where we have a destroyer \u2013 a relatively small ship \u2013 over there, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d want to be the captain of that ship right now.

We\u2019ve got great numbers. 38 to 12. That\u2019s good. But we fell a little behind in Iowa, and some people are saying how can it be. And I come out and I was just telling a group we have the biggest crowds, we have the most enthusiastic crowds. Everybody said and it\u2019s very true. I mean, look at this. Somebody else would come, they\u2019d have like 50 people and they wouldn\u2019t need this room. Believe me.

It\u2019s the craziest thing, right? But we\u2019ll take it. But they say the people are with \u2013 we have the most loyal people by far. Everybody says it. The other thing they say is for leadership, number one. Very important, right? Don\u2019t you think? Leadership. I mean, when leadership is number one \u2013 they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot. So you know it\u2019s great. I thought I\u2019d talk a little bit and I want to take some questions. You know, we can do a little question and answer. Right? We have all these cameras going back here. And you know, it\u2019s always tough when you\u2019re on live television all the time. Look, we have 10 topics. Right? How many topics? 10? How many different ways can you talk about the 10 topics? The bottom line is we want results. We want to get it done. But when you\u2019re on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then you\u2019re talking about immigration and you\u2019re talking about the wall because we\u2019re going to have a wall and we\u2019re going to stop illegal immigration. But we talk about trade and we talk about repealing Obamacare. And we talk about all the things that we talk about. But you know, you have these points and we could talk about them in different forms, in different ways and give different examples. But in the end, it\u2019s really about results. Isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s really about results. And you can only talk about the same subjects on live television so many different ways. I talk about industry. I talk about commerce. I talk about how we\u2019re losing our jobs to all of these different countries. And I give different examples. But it\u2019s still going to be a certain number of subjects.

They really want to do things and it\u2019s not going to happen. It\u2019s not going to happen. At  least with me it\u2019s not going to happen. That I can tell you.

And so we\u2019re going to have some fun. We\u2019re going to do that. A few things \u2013 I want to bring up a few new subjects. So, immigration, we\u2019re going to be doing a very strong number. It\u2019s killing us. It\u2019s killing us. And it\u2019s bad for the economy. It\u2019s bad for \u2013 all of this illegal immigration.

I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s honest about this thing. I watched Romney. I watched all \u2013 \u201cOh, I pay so much tax. I pay so much tax.\u201d I watched all politicians and they say \u201cI pay \u2013 \u201d I fight like hell to pay as little as possible. Can I say that? I\u2019m not a politician. I fight like hell always because it\u2019s an expense. And you know, I feel \u2013 I fight. I have the best lawyers and the best accountants and I fight. And I pay. But it\u2019s an expense. And frankly, I would feel differently if this country was spending the money wisely instead of throwing it out the drain. Our country spends our money so stupidly and I will tell you that I could speak for myself I pay a lot of tax but I fight like hell to make it as low as possible. But I would feel a lot differently if our leadership was such that I respected the decisions. All you have to do is look at a list of the things that our government is spending money on right now and you don\u2019t feel so good about our country. Question: \n[Inaudible]\n You know, right now, we have a false \u2013 5.4%, 5.3%, 5.6% \u2013 every month it\u2019s different. It\u2019s such a phony number. Because when people look and look and look and then they give up looking for a job, they\u2019re taken off the roll. So the number isn\u2019t reflective. I\u2019ve seen numbers of 24%. I actually saw a number of 42% unemployment. 42%. And it could be because when you\u2019re looking for a job and you go around and you look and you look and you find it, you want to work and you want to take care of your family and then you can\u2019t get the job \u2013 you know what I\u2019m talking about because you\u2019re shaking your head \u2013 and you can\u2019t get the job, essentially for statistically purposes you are considered employed. So then I read every time it comes out I hear 5.3% unemployment. That is the biggest joke there is in this country. That number is so false. And you know, people ask \u201cHow come Trump is doing so well? And Carson and others? How come they\u2019re doing -?\u201d You know why they\u2019re doing well? Because people are tired of political speak. They\u2019re tired of that. And the worst example of it \u2013 one of the worst example of it \u2013 is the phony unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is probably 20%. But I will tell you you have some great economists that will tell you it\u2019s 30%, 32%. And the highest I\u2019ve heard so far is 42%. There\u2019s anger out there at the job picture. Now, one of the things \u2013 with that being said, China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, these countries are all taking our jobs like we\u2019re a bunch of babies. That will stop. People will treat us fairly if I become President. We\u2019re losing our jobs. We\u2019re losing our base. We\u2019re losing our manufacturing. All of that will stop. Question: \n[Inaudible]\n Question: \n[Inaudible]\n If a corporation gives out a bigger dividend, that\u2019s great. Mr. Jones gets a bigger dividend, he\u2019s going to have more money to spend in the economy. So that\u2019s good. Question: \n[Inaudible]\n Question: \n[Inaudible]\n I\u2019ve done a great job. I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of people. I employ now thousands and thousands of people. I\u2019ve done a good job. But I wouldn\u2019t say populist at all. I would say I\u2019m a man of common sense. I\u2019m cutting taxes. I\u2019m going to create a lot of jobs. I\u2019m going to get rid of a tremendous amount of waste. And I\u2019ll tell you what. The waste that I get rid of \u2013 the waste that I get rid of \u2013 is going to have a huge impact and I\u2019m not even putting that in my numbers so I think it\u2019s going to be terrific. Question: \n[Inaudible]\n Where are you from? England? I love them. Oh, what a beautiful accent. No, I want to get the industry \u2013 we call it the automobile industry. But I want to get the automobile industry to build factories here. As you know, Ford is building $2.5 billion factory in Mexico. Mexico also took a big plant out of Tennessee and Tennessee thought they were going to get it and they didn\u2019t. I want the motor companies, as you would say, or the automobile companies to build their plants in the United States. I don\u2019t want Nabisco leaving for Mexico or any place else. I want these companies not to leave Chicago, not to leave Michigan, not to leave New Hampshire and Iowa and South Carolina and all of these places where they\u2019re leaving and they\u2019re going to other countries. I want them to stay here and they will stay here and they\u2019ll be so happy. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. It\u2019s been a great honor. Thank you.

To me, that\u2019s a compliment. No, I want to take that thinking to the White House. I would bet you we could save 20% of our budget. I could even save more. But we could save a tremendous amount. That has to be the attitude our country has. You can\u2019t spend millions and millions of dollars on doing something that you can do for $2,000. You know, when you look at costs, we just spent $1 million building a soccer field. Okay? A soccer field for our prisoners that happen to be in Guantanamo. Okay? I don\u2019t like that. What do you need $1 million for? Level out the surface, let them play \u2013 if they had to play at all. Okay? What do you need to spend $1 million.

Question: \n[Inaudible]\n Question: \n[Inaudible]\n And I think one of the reasons I am doing so well in the polls and one of the reasons I\u2019m doing so well when it comes to the economy in all polls is that this is the thinking. No, we\u2019re lowering taxes very substantially. We\u2019re simplifying. And we\u2019re getting rid of deductions that are actually obselete that certain people want to keep for certain reasons. So, no, that\u2019s not true. Question: \n[Inaudible]\n Scott Pelley interviewed me. I thought Scott was terrific. I mean, it was a tough interview but I thought he was very fair and I thought the piece was very good. Question: \n[Inaudible]\n Question: \n[Inaudible]\n And again it\u2019s called corporate inversion and in a lot of time corporations are moving out and they\u2019re going to other countries, taking jobs. And now, we have a really big problem because we have serious companies \u2013 very large, very prestigious companies as you know \u2013 obviously you know something about business. But we have major companies looking to move out of the United States. You know, it used to be they\u2019d move from New York to Florida. They\u2019d move from New Jersey to Texas. Or whatever. Now, they\u2019re talking about moving from the United States to Ireland and to England and to other places, to Spain where they get treated differently and frankly better. And they\u2019re doing that for a number of reasons but one of the reasons \u2013 one of the big reasons \u2013 as you know is taxes. One of the other reasons is to get all of this cash that they\u2019ve built up and they can\u2019t get back into our country. And when this money comes back into our country that everybody wants, it\u2019s going to be put to work in our country, largely. It can go other places. But largely. And I think it will be an amazing boon. Now, here\u2019s the other thing. They think it\u2019s $2.5 trillion. I think it\u2019s much more than that. I actually think it\u2019s going to be more money than that. And boy if it is, we have hit pay dirt.

And one of the things that they don\u2019t take into account in any big league fashion is the cutting. There is so much waste in government and I believe when I get in there I\u2019ll be able to cut without losing anything to cut tremendous amounts off of the \u2013 and we\u2019re not even showing anything for that. So, they\u2019re very conservative numbers. Question: \n[Inaudible]\n When I do my return, it will be much \u2013 my return go up to the ceiling and beyond, which is ridiculous. And you spend millions of dollars at a high level on lawyers, accountants, and everything else. We want to simplify them to a tremendous level. The bracket of 25% \u2013 the big difference is many of the loopholes and many of the deductions which are all \u2013 they\u2019ve been there for years \u2013 are antiquated in many cases. Or are put there because a lot of the people that get these deductions are contributed to Hillary, they\u2019re contributing to Bush. They\u2019re contributing to every candidate but Trump. Because I\u2019m not taking any money. I\u2019m self-funding. And these people want these deductions. There will be people \u2013 we\u2019re reducing taxes. But believe me, there will be people in the very upper eschelons that won\u2019t be thrilled with this. We\u2019re taking away deductions and that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re able to lower it. Question: \n[Inaudible]\n I believe that the economy will do so well that even though they won\u2019t be getting certain deductions which aren\u2019t fair for them to be getting that they\u2019ll end up doing better. Question: \n[Inaudible]\n I think this is a common sense, well thought out tax proposal that\u2019s going to trigger the economy, going to make everybody go back and really want to work. It\u2019s going to create tremendous numbers of jobs. One of the other things that I\u2019m coupling this with is if I become President, I\u2019m going to renegotiate our trade deals. Because our trade deals are not sustainable by this country. Not sustainable. We cannot continue to let our jobs go to all of the different countries. There\u2019s not a country that we negotiate with that doesn\u2019t make a better deal. Everybody. We lose money with everything. I\u2019m also going to renegotiate some of our military costs. Because we protect South Korea, we protect Germany, we protect some of the wealthiest countries in the world \u2013 Saudi Arabia \u2013 we protect everybody. We protect everybody. And we don\u2019t get reimbursement. We lose on everything. We lose on everything. So, we\u2019re going to negotiate and renegotiate trade deals, military deals, many other deals that\u2019s going to get the costs down for running our country very significantly. I\u2019m not showing a big number in that. But I believe that if I become President, those numbers are going to be massive. As an example, Saudi Arabia. They make $1 billion a day. We protect them. So we need help. We\u2019re losing a tremendous amount of money on a yearly basis and we owe $19 trillion. I used to say $18 trillion for the last 6, 7 months; now it\u2019s $19 trillion and it\u2019s only going up. Question: \n[Inaudible]\n In the NBC poll, I think we went from 26% to 29%. We\u2019re going up very strongly in the polls. They don\u2019t know what to do about it. I\u2019ve built a great company. You\u2019ll see that in 60 Minutes last night. I built a great company. It\u2019s a phenomenal company with very little debt, tremendous cash flow. I\u2019m funding my own campaign. Guys like Rubio, I mean, he desperately needs money. Ask the car dealer in Florida. Ask the people that support him. And a guy like Rubio and others \u2013 I don\u2019t want to single him out; you\u2019re singling him out \u2013 but they\u2019re largely controlled by their donors, the special interests, and frankly more than anybody else, the lobbyists. I\u2019ve turned down millions of millions of dollars from lobbyists and special interests because it\u2019s not the right thing. It\u2019s just not right. And that seems to be resonating very strongly. ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s remarks on tax reform \u2013 Part 3"}, {"text": "The number is probably $2.5 trillion. Everybody agrees it should come back \u2013 Republicans, Democrats, everybody. They can\u2019t make a deal. They don\u2019t know how to go about making a deal. The reason companies aren\u2019t bringing it back is the tax is onerous. It doesn\u2019t make sense to bring it back. And in fact, many companies are leaving the United States. They\u2019re leaving our shores to go and collect their money. They\u2019re going actually moving out of the United States for two reasons \u2013 the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they can\u2019t bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in. It\u2019s called leadership. We will have that money brought back in. As an example, I have millions of dollars overseas. I can\u2019t bring it back into this country. We filed papers. We\u2019ve been doing this for a year and a half. We can\u2019t get it back in. So the money stays in other countries and that\u2019s what happens. Not good for us. The level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important. But this is something \u2013 and I\u2019ve been watching it for a long time \u2013 everybody agrees to. We also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes \u2013 many of them actually \u2013 and deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on business income. The tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated, which don\u2019t make sense, and which are unfair are gone. And we phase in a reasonable cap on the deductability of the business interest expense. So we are going to give you \u2013 we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex. And we\u2019re going to hand them out right now to the press. And I think you\u2019ll see we have an amazing code. It will be simple. It will be easy. It will be fair. It\u2019s graduated. As you get up in income, you pay a little more. Some of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer. But I actually believe they\u2019ll do better because I think the economy will grow. It will grow rapidly. And we\u2019ll have something very special. Now, with all of that being said and before we take some questions, we have to cut the costs of what\u2019s going on in this country. If you look at what we\u2019re doing and the money we\u2019re spending. I read where a washer \u2013 you know what a washer is? Nuts, bolts, and washer \u2013 to send from one state to another, it was a 19 set washer and it cost $900,000 and some odd dollars to send it from here to there. And there are many examples. Hammers that cost $800 that you can buy in the store for a tiny amount of money. We will run this country properly. There is so much money to be saved. We\u2019re reducing taxes but at the same time if I win, if I become President, we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country. We won\u2019t be losing anything other than we\u2019ll be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be. So, this is a plan that\u2019s simple, that\u2019s a major reduction. I think people are going to be very happy. We\u2019ve already had some very good reviews. I did the plan with some of the leading scholars and economists and tax experts that there are in this country. They love it; they say \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t this been done before?\u201d And this is my wheelhouse. That\u2019s what I do well. The economy is what I do well. Whenever they do polls, I always come out way above everybody else on the economy and on leadership, by the way, but I won\u2019t say that. So, if anybody has \u2013 [applause] \u2013 thank you. That\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s some of the press was actually clapping. I\u2019ve never saw \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen that before. All right.

It\u2019s a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again. Too few Americans are working. Too many jobs are being shipped overseas. And too many middle income families cannot make ends meet. This plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business. It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction. It will simplify the tax code. It will grow the American economy at a level it hasn\u2019t seen for decades. And all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit. But I will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals, we have to negotiate much harder, and we\u2019ve got to make our economy strong. Changes for individuals will be at levels that you haven\u2019t seen in a long time. We\u2019re going to cut the individual rates from 7 brackets to 4. Simplification. 25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%. If you\u2019re single and earn less than $25,000 per year or married and jointly earn less than $50,000 \u2013 so, very important. If you\u2019re single and earn less than $25,000 or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you\u2019ll not pay any income tax \u2013 nothing. This eliminates very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty. Very unfair penalty. It eliminates the AMT, which is the alternative minimum tax. It ends the death tax. It\u2019s a double taxation. A lot of families go through hell over the death tax. It reduces or eliminates most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s going to cost me a fortune, which is actually true \u2013 while preserving charitable giving and mortagage interest deductions. Very importantly. It ends the current tax treatment of carried interest. Those are the hedge fund folks that I\u2019ve been talking about for quite a while. They make a lot of money. Carried interest. So it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital. Changes for business \u2013 now, so important, because it\u2019s all about business. It\u2019s all about jobs. We have 93 million people in this country that are in serious trouble, that want to work; they can\u2019t work. So for business, no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Big reduction. A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at significantly discount which coming back at a significantly discount \u2013 10%. So it comes back discounted at a 10% tax rate and ends the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad. Now, it\u2019s called corporate inversion. It\u2019s a huge subject.

They\u2019re getting a deal that\u2019s going to go right into nuclear weapons much sooner than you think. They\u2019re going to self-police \u2013 think about that one \u2013 they are going to go and self-police. They\u2019ve got the 24-day \u2013 they have 24-day provisions. And by the way, what people don\u2019t understand \u2013 the 24-day provision doesn\u2019t start \u2013 you know this, right? It doesn\u2019t start for a long time before you even get to it. The clock is ticking. It can take forever. We may never get it there. It is one of the dumbest deals and one of the weakest contracts I\u2019ve ever seen of any kind. So, we are going to do things and this country right. We\u2019re not going to sign deals where we have four prisoners over there and there\u2019s still there and we don\u2019t even ask for them. One of them is there because he\u2019s a Christian. We have a writer. We have \u2013 the whole thing is absolutely insane. You know, they asked the President, and they asked Secretary of State Kerry who maybe \u2013 you know, I\u2019ve been saying Hillary Clinton is the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. Right? All right. I\u2019ve been saying it. But it\u2019s possible \u2013 the world blew up around her. It blew up. Just blew up. The whole world is like a different place. It\u2019s possible that because of this deal made by Secretary Kerry who has absolutely no clue how to negotiate, it may that he\u2019s going to supersede. And I understand that he may want to run for President. He has no chance like she has no chance. So we\u2019re going to see what happens. We have many problems in our country. One of them is immigration. Now, I took a tremendous hit when I brought up illegal immigration when I announced I was running for President. And for two weeks, I said \u2013 you know, Rush Limbaugh \u2013 he\u2019s a great guy \u2013 he said \u201cHe has suffered more incoming\u201d \u2013 meaning the press \u2013 \u201cthan anybody I\u2019ve seen.\u201d So what happened is you have now found out what illegal immigration is all about and I am so happy that I\u2019m the one that brought it to the fore because believe me, it\u2019s a big problem. It is a big problem. So you remember for about two weeks, I said, \u201cBoy this is tougher than I thought running for President.\u201d And then you found out there\u2019s tremendous crime. There\u2019s tremendous drugs pouring across the border. Tremendous. Beyond. Going to Chicago, going to New York, going to LA, going all over our country.

You know, Joe [Arends] and the group [Veterans for a Strong America] called and they said \u201cWould you come over and speak?\u201d I\u2019m here for a certain reason. You know, it\u2019s called tomorrow night. So I got here and they asked a couple of days ago if it would possible to come over and say a few words. An endorsement from your group with so many veterans \u2013 hundreds of thousands of veterans \u2013 I really appreciate that, Joe. I did not expect that. I didn\u2019t expect it. I didn\u2019t ask for it. I will say this: I am with the veterans 100%. They\u2019re our greatest people. They\u2019re being treated terribly. Not only the number of deaths, which are obviously \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s going on is incredible. But as of two weeks ago on Wednesday, the vets had the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. You go in to see a doctor, you wait for days, for days. And it\u2019s not going to happen. Not going to happen. If I win, believe me, it\u2019s not going to happen. And one of the things I thought I\u2019d do and I\u2019d stress so strongly \u2013 the veterans hospitals \u2013 obviously they have problems. They\u2019re not properly run. And when you have to wait long hours and long days and then in some cases have the doctor say \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m going on vacation\u201d, believe me, it doesn\u2019t get much worse than that. So we\u2019re going to create a whole new system. We\u2019re going to take this system apart. And if they\u2019re not doing the job, the veterans are going to go to private doctors, private hospitals, public hospitals, and we\u2019re going to reimburse those doctors and those hospitals. And you\u2019re going to get the greatest service of any veterans in any country because you deserve it. And that\u2019s going to be broken down into something that\u2019s going to be very special. Right now \u2013 and you know it \u2013 we have illegal immigrants that are treated better by far than our veterans. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore. It\u2019s not going to happen. So, Joe, I just really appreciate it. So unexpected. To be here is an honor. They don\u2019t build ships like this anymore, folks. You know? We don\u2019t do them this way anymore. I actually said what about recommissioning \u2013 look at this thing. The largest guns in the world. The most powerful guns. I learned about the Iowa. By the way, Iowa is a great place for a lot of reasons. You know? We have been treated so well in the state of Iowa. It\u2019s been incredible. Number one on the polls and we love those people. They\u2019re great. So this is a great ship and that\u2019s a great state.

It\u2019s such an honor. I was called by Sen. [Ted] Cruz a few days ago and he said, \u201cDo you think we can get a really good crowd out here to protest this incompetent deal?\u201d And I said, \u201cBoy, can we get a crowd.\u201d And that was three days ago and look what shows up and I want to thank you. I want to thank you. So, I\u2019ve been doing deals for a long time. I\u2019ve been making lots of wonderful deals, great deals. That\u2019s what I do. Never, ever, ever in my life have I seen any transaction so incompetently negotiated as our deal with Iran. And I mean, never. Now, Ted and everybody else have gone through all of the details and we can talk about the 24 days, which is ridiculous. We can talk about the $150 billion, which by the way they get even if the deal isn\u2019t approved. They get it just for going to the table. We can talk about the fact that we have four wonderful people over there and frankly they\u2019re never going to come back with this group. And I\u2019ll say this: If I win the presidency, I guarantee you that those four prisoners are back in our country before I even take office. I guarantee that. They will be back before I ever take office because they know that\u2019s what has to happen. Okay? They know it. And if they don\u2019t know it, I\u2019m telling them right now. So, I have a story that just came out an hour ago and as President Obama calls him very routinely, he calls him the Supreme Leader. Our President is calling the person who is really the boss in Iran Supreme Leader and I look at people shaking their head; they can\u2019t believe it. But it just came out a little while ago, he said \u201cIsrael will not exist in 25 years.\u201d Think of that. He just said this. He also said very strongly, very, very strongly that \u201cThis is the end of our dealings with the United States. We want nothing more to do with them. We\u2019re not going to do anything right here. We made this deal. It\u2019s a phenomenal deal. We\u2019re not going to deal with the United States anymore.\u201d And that\u2019s what he just said and this was a very short period of time ago. So, they rip us off. They take our money. They make us look like fools. And now they\u2019re back to being who they really are. They don\u2019t want Israel to survive. They will not let Israel survive with incompetent leadership like we have right now. Israel will not survive. And then when it\u2019s all done or they think it\u2019s all done, they come out with these unbelievable nasty statements that Israel won\u2019t be around in 25 years and that we will have no dealings and we will have no further dealings with the United States. Now, the people that we were negotiating with and were working on the sanctions, with including and as an example Russia who is selling tremendous missiles to Iran. You know that. Ballistic missiles being sold. All of these countries \u2013 all of these countries \u2013 are going to do business with Iran. They\u2019re going to make lots of money and lots of other things with Iran. And we\u2019re going to do \u2013 and we\u2019re going to get nothing. Nothing. We are led by very, very stupid people. Very, very stupid people. We cannot let it continue. We are a country that owes $19 trillion. We lose everywhere. We lose militarily. We can\u2019t beat ISIS. Give me a break! We can\u2019t beat anybody. Our vets are being treated horribly. It will change. We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning. Believe me. I agree. You \u2018ll never get bored of winning. We\u2019d never get bored. We are going to turn this country around. We are going to start winning big league on trade, militarily. We\u2019re going to build up our military. We\u2019re going to have such a strong military that nobody \u2013 nobody \u2013 is going to mess with us. We\u2019re not going to have to use it.

I don\u2019t know that to be true. But I think it depends on what happens with her. I think if she gets out, he will get in. I think if she stays in, he might not. Who knows? Question:\n[Inaudible]\n So I suggested frankly that I\u2019m fine with him not being here because I don\u2019t want anybody to think he\u2019s endorsing. As far as Jeb is concerned, I watched him this morning on television and it\u2019s a little bit sad. Don\u2019t forget. He was supposed to win. And he just doesn\u2019t have the energy. But what he does have is a lot of money that was given to him again by special interests, donors, and lobbyists. And I just hope that if he spends money on ads, which he may not \u2013 if I were him, I\u2019d spend money on positive ads about himself. Because if he knocks me, assuming people leave and maybe they\u2019re at a point where they\u2019re not going to leave because they\u2019re fed up with what\u2019s happening in this country, but I think they\u2019re going to go to people other than Jeb. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n And I don\u2019t mean by number one. I mean like number one by many, many times. And I am so intent on putting people back to work in this country. You know, we have 93 million people that are not in the workforce right now. 93 million. When they give up looking for a job, they take them off of the stats. They take them off the statistics. We have 93 million people. We have 50 million people between poverty levels and welfare and all. Our country can be great again. We have to put people back to work. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n The second part I won\u2019t bother asking you. It\u2019s no longer pertinent. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n So, Kanye West \u2013 I love him. Now, maybe in a few years I\u2019ll have to run against him. I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019ll take that back. But he\u2019s been so nice to me. You people have sort of seen because I\u2019ve been a counter-puncher. I only hit people when they hit me. Only. And Kanye West has been so great. I would never say bad about him because he says such nice things about me. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Japan is devaluing their yen. Very hard for Caterpillar and other companies to compete against Komatsu \u2013 their big tractor maker \u2013 and others. We\u2019re not going to let this happen anymore. They do \u2013 you talk about a trade imbalance. They have in Japan the biggest ships you\u2019ve ever seen pouring cars into Los Angeles, pouring them in. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. We send them beef and they don\u2019t even want it. It\u2019s going to end and they\u2019re going to like us. In this building, I have the largest bank in the world. Right up these elevators. It\u2019s a bank from China. By far the biggest bank in the world. I get along great with China. I get along great with Japan. I get along great with Mexico. I love the people. I love the people of Mexico. I love the Hispanics. I have thousands of Hispanics right now working for me. Over the years, I have employed tens of thousands of Hispanics \u2013 many from Mexico. I have unbelievably great relationships. And in the package that we gave you, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a poll and I\u2019m number one with Hispanics. You saw that. Number one with Hispanics. So, look, for our country to be great, we have to be able to make great deals. We\u2019re going to be great to the vets. We\u2019re going to be terrific. Our military is going to be unbelievable. All of these things \u2013 we\u2019re going to get rid of Obamacare and come up with something that\u2019s much better and much less expensive. We\u2019re going to get rid of it. We\u2019re going to repeal it. It\u2019s going to be out. Should have been out a long time ago. Should have never happened.

And they\u2019re making him do it because he\u2019s crashing in the polls.

I mean nobody\u2019s ever spent money on ads against me. But he probably has to do that although it would not be the way I\u2019ve done. You know, one of the things I\u2019m most honored about is that so far everybody that\u2019s attacked me has gone down the tubes. You have Lindsey Graham attacked me. He was at 3%. Now he\u2019s at zero. You have Perry attacked me. Now he\u2019s getting out of the race. He was at 4% or 5%. Now he\u2019s getting out of the race. He was at zero.

I see the last poll \u2013 the Monmouth poll that just came out today where I\u2019m leading by double figures and Rand Paul is down to less than 2% and he attacked me. Now, Jeb Bush also just went down in the Monmouth poll very big. So I don\u2019t know. Are they going to spend \u2013 he\u2019s going to spend lobbyist money and special interest money. Remember this \u2013 they have total control over Jeb and Hillary and everybody else that takes that money. Nobody knows the system better than me. They have total control. You understand it very well because you\u2019ve been covering it for a long time. Those people that are putting up those millions of dollars have total control over your candidate. I will tell you this: Nobody\u2019s putting up millions of dollars for me. I\u2019m putting up my own money. In fact, I feel a little bit foolish. People are offering me millions and millions of dollars. You know, when you\u2019re in first place, you can collect so much money and I keep turning them down. I feel like \u2013 am I a fool? I feel very foolish. And when I was in Iowa last week, I said \u201cWhat do you think? Can I take \u2013 \u201c One man offered me \u2013 a big lobbyist \u2013 offered $5 million for my campaign. I said to the crowd in Iowa \u2013 great crowd, 4,000 people \u2013 I said \u201cCan I take it? And would you believe I\u2019m not going to do anything? I promise you. I swear to you I won\u2019t do anything.\u201d And they all stood up and said \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t take it.\u201d The fact is I\u2019m the only self-funder. I\u2019m putting up my own money. I know there have been some super PACs \u2013 5 or 6 super PACs \u2013 where people are forming super PACs for Trump. I have nothing to do with them. As you know, you\u2019re not allowed to have anything to do with them. So I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do. Hopefully, if they\u2019re going to do something it\u2019s going to be nice. But I don\u2019t know anything about them. But just in a nutshell, I\u2019m funding my own campaign. Nobody else\u2019s. When people advertise \u2013 and I hope the voters can see this.

[Ray] Ordierno said that the Army is in the worst shape in its history in terms of preparedness. Now, for them to be in bad shape with the way we are and with the world hating us, and you look at Hillary Clinton \u2013 and I\u2019ve said she\u2019s the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. Now, in all fairness, because of the agreement that\u2019s about to be finalized with Iran, John Kerry may very well take her place. I think that agreement is a disaster for this country, for Israel, for the Middle East. It\u2019s going to lead to nuclear proliferation \u2013 the 24-day clause \u2013 everything about it.

Thank you all for being here. This is some turnout. My great honor. The Chairman just left as you probably know and he\u2019s been extremely fair. The RNC has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period. And as you know, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted. I wanted fairness. I don\u2019t have to be treated any differently than anybody else. I just wanted fairness from the Republican Party. We\u2019re leading in every single poll. A new poll came out today where we\u2019re over 30%. We\u2019ve actually hit numbers as high as 35% and 40%. And frankly, I\u2019ve felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the Democrats and very easily I think beat the Democrats no matter who it may be whether it\u2019s Hillary or anybody else and I think maybe Hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what\u2019s happening getting to the starting gate, the best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up. And for that reason, I have signed the pledge. So I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win. We will win. And most importantly, we will make our country great again because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. We have to make our country great again.

They use it all the time. It\u2019s called using your head. It\u2019s called using the laws. Actually I did a good job didn\u2019t I at the debate when Chris Matthews so angrily said \u2013 I do what every other great businessman does. I buy a company \u2013 you know, it\u2019s one company was sort of interesting. A friend of mine had it. Good guy. And the banks were just killing him. They were mean. And banks can be mean, right? You\u2019ve got to teach them how to behave, right? So this guy was just getting beaten. And I did him a favor and I called up the banks. And I said \u201cDo me this, do this, do this, do that.\u201d They said, \u201cWe won\u2019t do that. No, we won\u2019t do that.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d Anyways, it\u2019s sort of a little bit complicated\u2026I bought it. Immediately, I called them back and said, \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d I threw it into a chapter. And they come out with the story \u201cTrump files bankruptcy\u201d. Can you believe it? I negotiated it to hell. What I did to that bank \u2013 ayeyeye. They see me walking down the street and they go \u201cHey, hey, hey.\u201d But then I\u2019m good at that stuff, you know? I\u2019m really good at that stuff. But you have to use the laws to your advantage. No, no, you have to use it to your advantage. Atlantic City. You know, you look at Atlantic City. Caesar\u2019s went bankrupt. Whoever heard of Caesar\u2019s? Caesar\u2019s filed Chapter 11. Nobody cares. Everybody in Atlantic City. I had the good sense seven years ago and actually the financial media gives me great credit because I have a vision for things. I said, \u201cDon\u2019t go into Iraq\u201d even though I\u2019m a very militaristic person. I said \u201cDon\u2019t go into Iraq\u201d and they shouldn\u2019t have because I said you\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East. So what did we get \u2013 $2 trillion. Thousands of deaths. Thousands. Like 5,000. Wounded warriors who I love all over the place. We can\u2019t even go there. Iran is taking over Iraq. With the money that we\u2019re giving them, they\u2019re going to take off and they\u2019re going to get the oil, they\u2019re going to get everything. The oil they don\u2019t get ISIS is getting. What do we get? Nothing. We get nothing. We got far less than nothing. So I had vision in 2004 \u2013 Reuters \u2013 actually it was before that but they wrote a story. Trump says don\u2019t do Iraq. Now, I\u2019m much more militaristic than Bush, even the brother. But you got to know where to use it and when. You got to use. So with Atlantic City, seven years ago, I got out. That\u2019s called vision. I should get credit for vision. And again, this isn\u2019t bragging. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t say this but I need your fricking votes. Do you understand that? Do you understand that? I mean, normally I wouldn\u2019t. So I got great credit. I got out. But most of the places in Atlantic City are either in trouble or they\u2019re bankrupt. They went bankrupt. But I made a lot of money in Atlantic City. I had a great time in Atlantic City but they asked me a nasty question, I gave a great answer. I thought. So I think I solved it. Listen, we are going to do things that are going to make you so proud if I win. We are going to have victories again. We are going to win. In fact, last night in front of the audience and I\u2019ve never said this before. Last night in front of the audience I said we\u2019re going to have so many victories. And then I said we\u2019re going to win here. We\u2019re going to win on trade. We\u2019re going to win militarily in terms of not having wars but just having such great strength that nobody\u2019s going to play with us. Nobody\u2019s going to mess with us. Okay? Nobody. And we\u2019re going to have victories. So many victories that are going to be coming out\u2026In fact, you might get tired of victories. You may not want anymore\u2026And everyone stood up and said \u201cNo, no, no, we want to keep winning.\u201d If I win, we will have victories all over. We will win on trade. We will win on health care. We will win on everything. I will protect your Social Security without cuts. I will protect your Medicare and your Medicaid.

We\u2019re going to be \u2013 you know, you look at what\u2019s going on with Baltimore, you look at what\u2019s going on in Chicago and Ferguson and St. Louis the other night. We are going to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin. You know, we can be very tough. I just met your cops outside. Those police are tough cookies. Those guys \u2013 we need law and order. We need law and order. I mean, they allowed \u2013 in one night, that first night in Baltimore \u2013 they allowed that city to be destroyed. And they set it back 35 years. One night. Because the police were not allowed to protect people. They weren\u2019t allowed to protect people.

You know, I know you\u2019re going to have some bad apples. You\u2019re going to have problems. I see some of the things. You did too and it\u2019s disgusting and it\u2019s horrible. But that\u2019s such a tiny percentage. The problem is the good work doesn\u2019t get shown on television. All of the good work, which is 99.9%. I mean, the good work with the police. It\u2019s 99.9%. That one little thing. And it\u2019s horrible. I agree. I hated some of the things. I don\u2019t have to go into them.

I won\u2019t mention names but I know cities where police are afraid to even talk to people because they want to be able to retire and have their pension; they don\u2019t want to be thrown off the police force. And then you wonder why there\u2019s crimes in our cities. So we need a whole new mindset. We have to build up our military. We have to make our military so strong. We have to make our military so powerful and so strong that we never have to use it. We never have to use it. We also have to focus on what we have \u2013 look, Ukraine.

We\u2019re sending fighters every \u2013 Where\u2019s Germany? Where are all these European countries? It affects them. It affects them. And we want to stand alongside of them. I agree.

No, he has no respect for our President and our President doesn\u2019t like him in all fairness. They don\u2019t have good chemistry to put it mildly, would you say. But I\u2019d get along with these people. Think of it. Every country is ripping us off. Even Russia is ripping us off because in the Iran deal, which is going to go down as one of the worst deals ever, Russia is a big beneficiary because they\u2019re going to sell Iran missiles with the money we give to Iran. Think of that. So one of the biggest beneficiaries is Russia. Okay? But think of it.

This is a serious wall. Okay? This is a wall you don\u2019t go through so easy. They built a wall 2,000 years ago that\u2019s 13,000 miles. Think of that. That\u2019s a big wall. That\u2019s serious wall, right? This was 2,000 years ago. I mean, it took them like 500 years to build it so you know, I got to be a little bit \u2013 you know, took a long time. But 13,000 miles that\u2019s a long time. They had no tractors. They didn\u2019t have Caterpillars. Of course, today, we use Komatsus because they\u2019re made in Japan and you could buy them cheaper. How stupid is that? Because they devalued the yen so much and people are buying Komatsus instead of Caterpillars. Caterpillar\u2019s stock is down. It\u2019s terrible. We\u2019ll change that around. Believe me. Believe me. But, they build this wall. Now, we have really 15 \u2013 I would say \u2013 look we have 2,000 miles as opposed to 13,000. But you don\u2019t need it on all of it because some you have natural landscaping, some you have a lot of places. And actually 10 years ago, everybody wanted the wall built. Hillary wanted it built. But they couldn\u2019t. Because I\u2019m a great builder. What I do best is build. I\u2019m not a rendering guy. I do the building and then do the rendering. A lot of these guys come in with renderings and it never gets built. Does that make sense to anybody? I\u2019m the opposite. I get it built. So, one of the reasons it couldn\u2019t get built is because they couldn\u2019t get an approved environmental impact study. Do you believe this? No, no, they had certain snail doggers and different things. They couldn\u2019t get it. They could not get an environmental impact study approved to build a wall. And they\u2019re killing people. We have illegal immigrants. You see that with Kate in San Francisco. You see it with Jamiel. You see it with so many people. Last night in Massachusetts I met some unbelievable families that have been devastated by illegal immigrants. They come into this country and kill members of their family. Last week in California, a 66-year-old veteran \u2013 a female, a veteran, 66 \u2013 got raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed. Raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed. 66-years-old. By an illegal immigrant that they caught, that they caught luckily. But this is what we have. We have stupid people in our government and we have people pouring across the border. And you know what? We have great border patrol people. I went there. You probably saw that. That\u2019s why the hat is so successful. The white one, right? But I went there, everybody wants to buy the hat. Now they like the white one. Then two weeks later, I wore the red one. The white one didn\u2019t sell so well. The red one sells. Crazy thing. But I went to the border and I got to know the people and I saw people, and you know it\u2019s rough stuff, it\u2019s rough stuff. And when I first came in and when I first did my opening statement that I was running for President, I talked about illegal immigration. I was killed by the press. Rush Limbaugh, who I think is a terrific guy, said \u201cTrump has received more incoming than any human being I\u2019ve ever seen. Then he goes and has a news conference and I think he\u2019s going to apologize and he doubles down.\u201d I got credit. I got credit. No, they thought I was going to apologize. And I don\u2019t mind apologizing but I have to make a mistake to apologize and I was right. No, I was right. So for two weeks, as Rush said, I took incoming\u2026In fact that was my first two weeks. I said \u201cIs it going to be like this for the next year and a half?\u201d I don\u2019t know if I can make it. It was brutal. Now, many of those people that talked that way, many of those people, they\u2019ve apologized to me. Everybody says I\u2019m right.

If you want a nice person, honestly you should vote for Jeb. The country is going to go to hell but we won\u2019t talk of that. No, no, but if you want a nice person.

And that\u2019s what I alluded to before. The Times said, \u201cDonald Trump railed at him and screamed at him.\u201d I didn\u2019t scream at him. But he was screaming at me. And much worse than that, they said I wore a toupee. Can you believe it? I don\u2019t wear a toupee, and I proved it \u2013 I won\u2019t bring anybody up. I won\u2019t bring anybody up. But I don\u2019t. But think of it. I\u2019m in the front page of the New York Times and in the first sentence in the first paragraph has this announcer \u2013 this Hispanic announcer that nobody ever heard of \u2013 saying they called him something which means he wears a toupee. And I don\u2019t. ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Nashville, Tennessee \u2013 Part 9"}, {"text": "So it says \u201c$50 million or more\u201d, I go 50. So they\u2019ll take $50 million for a building that might be worth a billion and honestly much more.

Those statements aren\u2019t really meant for me \u2013 it\u2019s not meant for a guy like me. But with all of that the statements were so good. They\u2019re so good. They\u2019re so good. And you know, one of the things I\u2019m doing and last night was incredible. We had an amazing event in Massachusetts. Right? Oh, look at this, we have a wit- what the hell are you doing in Nashville? What are you doing? \u2026Anyway, so here I am. I spent millions of dollars during the course on jet fuel. Okay? Like a lot of money on jets. But somebody puts up a sign $100 to go to this thing. I didn\u2019t know who did it. But somebody puts up a sign. So all over the place, I\u2019m spending millions of dollars. I\u2019m turning down millions. I don\u2019t want your money. I don\u2019t want your money. Somebody puts a sign up talking about $100 contribution, which you didn\u2019t have to make. But they put it up. It\u2019s all over CNN. \u201cTrump is asking for $100.\u201d I fly my plane some place it costs me a fortune. The fuel. The $100. The money that I raised last night, which says it all it goes towards paying off like the expense or something. The guy that had it is a great guy \u2013 Ernie. A great guy. Really successful guy. You know him, right? Ernie. He\u2019ll sell you a car any day of the week, right? And you know the guy is \u2013 like 2,000 people showed up. Let him get a little deferment of the roast beef or whatever the hell they\u2019re serving. So they put up a sign. I don\u2019t want the money. I might like $4 or $5 million. That\u2019s hard to turn down. But the hundred dollars times some people and we let the vets there, we let most of the people I think came in free. And I end up with this big story \u2013 \u201cTrump accepting contributions\u201d. I can\u2019t believe it. I got so angry at my people. Because somebody put up a sign saying $100. And honestly, first of all, it\u2019s like peanuts. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. But they used to it to try and marginalize. They always do. They always do. The bottom line is I am self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m self-funding. I don\u2019t want to have anybody giving. I don\u2019t need money. Now, with that being said, the small money comes in and it\u2019s not a lot of money but it\u2019s great money. Like Beada might send me some money. Beada will send me some money. But a woman sent me $7 with a beautiful letter from Georgia. Another person sent me $12. Small money. And some sent me $1,000. But it doesn\u2019t amount to a lot. But that I do like coming in because they invest in the campaign. How do I take the $7 check, right, and send it back to the person who sent it to me from Georgia? \u201cDear So and So, I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t really want your money.\u201d How do you write a letter like that? I want them to invest in it. You know, but they\u2019re not going to tell me not to do this or not to do that for China because they are lobbyists for China and they gave me $5 million. I had a big lobbyist asked me to have \u2013 he wanted to give me $5 million for my campaign. I turned him down. I turned him down. And then I see this story on CNN last night. It was disgusting. That look there\u2019s a sign \u2013 $100! Somebody does a sign. It actually was a beautiful sign if you want to know the truth. It was so beautiful. It was beautifully done. And they\u2019re doing this big thing about all day long last night about \u2013 I said we had this incredible event and they destroyed it by trying to marginalize. And that\u2019s the press. That\u2019s the media. Yeah, the criminal media. I mean, there\u2019s truth to it. No, because a lot of times they know it\u2019s wrong. But I just want to tell you so important to me and last night it was such an incredible event. It had to be a record for a house. The guy got a beautiful house, got a big lawn, put up a tent. But we had 2,000 people. It had to be a record. The spirit in that group, the spirit in Alabama, the spirit was so incredible. The spirit in our last meeting in Iowa. Don\u2019t forget. When I went to Iowa and you know what I love? I\u2019m leading with Tea Party. Big. I love Tea Party. I love the Tea Party. Tea Party people, stand up and take a bow.

No, no, we\u2019re going to make a great deal because that\u2019s what happens. You know, that\u2019s what happens. So, we\u2019re going to take back our trade. If you look at China, if you look at Japan \u2013 I was in Los Angeles a few weeks ago. I saw ships \u2013 the biggest ships I\u2019ve ever seen with cars pouring our, pouring out one after another, made in Japan, very nice. Everything\u2019s nice. Except that it doesn\u2019t help us. When does it help us? When does it help us? We sell them beef. Beef. And then they don\u2019t want it. Because you know, do you ever see what\u2019s going on over there? We sell the beef and it goes over there and it\u2019s very perishable. So by the time it gets over there, then they turn it over \u201cWe don\u2019t want it.\u201d They have cars coming from these massive, massive ships. Massive. And they just pour off the ships. And I say, \u201cWhat are we doing? How stupid are we? No tax, no nothing.\u201d And I\u2019m a free trader. I believe in free trade. I have to say. But I have to be fair trade. When you look at Japan, they take in money up here and we give them money down here. We get nothing by comparison. It\u2019s like peanuts. Balance it out, fellows. Balance it out. Got to balance it. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. As you know, China has \u2013 it\u2019s probably the greatest theft in the history of the United States what China has done to us. They\u2019ve taken our money. They\u2019ve taken our jobs. They\u2019ve taken everything. They\u2019ve taken so much. And they\u2019re creating a bubble and you know interestingly we\u2019re so intertwined that now the bubble could take us down if it explodes, which at some point it might. And we\u2019ve got to be smart. I made so much money dealing with China. I made hundreds of millions, probably billions, dealing with China. The Bank of America building in San Francisco \u2013 I own a big chunk of that, which nobody knows. Nobody knows. You know, all these guys come to Forbes. \u201cOh, Trump\u2019s worth only $5 billion or $4 billion.\u201d Or whatever. \u201cHe\u2019s only worth $5 billion.\u201d It\u2019s like a bankrupt magazine\u2026They don\u2019t even know my numbers. They said, \u201cWell, we haven\u2019t been able to look at about 400 of his companies.\u201d So I filed. Interestingly, they said \u201cHe\u2019ll never run. He\u2019ll never run.\u201d \u2026Then I announced. Then they said, \u201cOh, he\u2019ll never file his form whatever.\u201d That\u2019s a single page where basically you\u2019re signing your life away and it has to be done within 14 days of the announcement. I signed my form. And they said, \u201cWell, he\u2019ll never ever put in his financials.\u201d And you have like 90 days or something. And they said, \u201cHe\u2019ll ask for extensions but he\u2019ll never show because he\u2019s probably not as rich as people think.\u201d But actually I\u2019m much richer and I put in my financials \u2013 it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. And Forbes and another group said, \u201cNo, no, we don\u2019t know what these companies are.\u201d I put in these massive financials, and you know, I was so proud. I might have filed if I wasn\u2019t going to run. I wanted to show people. I wanted to brag. It\u2019s such a great company I\u2019ve built. So they said, \u201cHe\u2019ll never put in his financials.\u201d I put in the financials. And everybody \u2013 they\u2019re much bigger. It\u2019s a much bigger \u2013 you know, very little debt, tremendous value. And really great assets. Iconic assets. You know, iconic. Doral, Turnberry in Scotland. I mean, I have some of the greatest real estates in the world. And I\u2019m very proud of it. But they say, \u201cHe\u2019ll never file. He\u2019ll never file.\u201d Then they see all these companies. And you know, they have boxes. And because it wasn\u2019t really meant for somebody like me, and they have these little boxes. They say, \u201cIs it worth or does he make $1 million, from $1 million to $5 million, from $5 million to $10 million, from $10 million to $20 million?\u201d The last box is $50 million or more. $50 million or more. So like I have a lot of buildings that are worth much more than that. I have a lot of assets that are worth much more than that. So it says \u201c$50 million or more\u201d. So I checked many of them. I don\u2019t know how many. I think there\u2019s 23 of them. Can you believe it? So I checked like, I don\u2019t know, I think it\u2019s 23. I could be wrong. Oh, they\u2019ll kill me if I\u2019m wrong. But I\u2019m not sure. But I think it\u2019s like 23 boxes. $50 million or more. So you know when some of these guys do to try and always marginalize you? They added up 23 50s. Now, some of the 50s are worth a billion. Some of them are worth more than a billion.

Too bad. Well, thank you. You know, the funny thing about The Apprentice \u2013 there have been 15 copies of The Apprentice. Every single one of them failed. So then a reporter said to me, \u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d I said \u201cBecause I\u2019m special.\u201d And I was kidding. I was doing it sarcastically \u2013 I mean, I sort of meant it to be honest, right? But I was sort of kidding. And they wrote it and I hated the way it looked in writing. You know, it sounds good when you say it but oh it looks so bad in writing. But so I had a great experience. So here I am \u2013 great schools, great brain, great success, built a great company, do The Apprentice, tremendous success. When I did The Apprentice, a certain critic said \u201cIt will never be successful\u201d because you know to have a big hit \u2013 a really a number one hit \u2013 you have to \u2013 and you remember that first season it had one of the highest ratings ever. The finale of The Apprentice? Aye! Remember with the great Bill Rancic. Remember how that was? Incredible. But to have a great success, you have to have women. And I\u2019ll never forget \u2013 I saved the article. Right? Like Harry Truman saved it where it said, \u201cTruman loses\u201d and he actually won. Remember? But I saved this article. They said \u201cTrump can never succeed on television because why would women want to watch Donald Trump?\u201d And I said, \u201cAm I so bad? Am I so bad?\u201d Tell me, am I so bad? And it turned out that women were the biggest base. I mean, those were the ones that liked\u2026So you know I saved those things. But no matter how you cut it, we can do something so incredible. And honestly, it\u2019s going to be hard. It\u2019s going to be a lot of work. It\u2019s going to be a lot of time. I wouldn\u2019t leave the White House. You know, Obama always leaves the White House. Think of it. You\u2019re elected President. You\u2019re in the White House. Why would you want to leave? I think I\u2019d maybe never leave! How cool is that? He leaves to go to some place and go fundraisers. I\u2019ll try \u2013 I don\u2019t know maybe there\u2019s some rules against it. So maybe I can\u2019t. But I\u2019ll do the fundraisers in the White House. He and his wife left \u2013 I think one was doing the Ellen show another was doing another show right next door in Burbank, California. They left a couple of hours difference. One took Air Force One; one took a beautiful Boeing 757. Two planes. A little bit different timing going to the same location, going to the same airport to do different shows. And I say why? Why aren\u2019t they flying at least the same plane? Now, I know what those suckers cost because I happen to have one of them right? So I know what it costs to operate these planes\u2026More importantly, the time and the energy. But I would have said Ellen or I would have said whoever was doing the show, \u201cLet\u2019s do it from the White House.\u201d This way, I take a half and hour, I go back, I don\u2019t spend any money of the taxpayers. \u2026And you know the funny thing is that whoever the host is would like it better. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our show live from the White House or something\u201d. So we don\u2019t pay any money. We don\u2019t have to fuel up Air Force One, which costs you \u2013 do you ever see what it costs to travel in these things?  With hundreds and hundreds of security and you\u2019re closing down Burbank, California. I mean, every time Obama comes to Manhattan to do a fundraiser, which is often, I say \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You can\u2019t move. They closed down all the streets. They closed down the city.\u201d And he could do it from like Washington. In fact, he could do it in my new hotel that I\u2019m buying which is only a couple of blocks. \u2026It\u2019s true. I\u2019m building this incredible hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue and it\u2019s going to be incredible. The Old Post Office. And I actually got it from the Obama administration, which is hard to believe. People say \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? How did Trump get it?\u201d One of the most heavily sought after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration, which owned it. You know, they\u2019re the ones that made the decision. And I got it and we\u2019re building this phenomenal hotel \u2013 Trump International Hotel \u2013 right on Pennsylvania Avenue directly between Congress and the White House. Right? It\u2019s going to open just in time \u2013 and by the way, listen to this one. We\u2019re under budget and ahead of schedule. Do you ever hear that from government? Way under budget. So we\u2019re actually going to be opening and it\u2019ll be great. But he can use my hotel. I\u2019ll let him use it free. You just come in, use it, go back to the White House. But you don\u2019t have to do that. But you\u2019d say to yourself why \u2013 you know, it\u2019s a mindset. But more importantly even in the travel, we have so many things that we have to do to straighten out our country. You don\u2019t want to waste time. You\u2019ve got to do this.

You\u2019re going to really see it go up because that has a huge negative impact not only on jobs but on the deficit itself because of the costs. And it\u2019s no good. Have you noticed \u2013 and you\u2019ve seen it yourself \u2013 the premiums have gone through the roof? Right? The deductibility \u2013 unless you\u2019re close to death, you\u2019re never going to use it. You can\u2019t use it because the deductibility is so high. But the premiums are up 30%, 40%, and 50% and more. It\u2019s a disaster. And on top of that, it\u2019s going to cost the country a fortune. So it\u2019s not only costing you a lot of money, it\u2019s going to cost the country a fortune. So we have to do something about it. And we have to do something importantly about it. But when I see the people on television and I have to tell you I won\u2019t mention names, some of them when they hear my name \u2013 I was talking \u2013 we have a great reporter today from the Wall Street Journal with us.

I came out. I made a fortune, which I want to use the brain for you, but I made a fortune. I then did a book called The Art of the Deal and many bestsellers. The Art of the Deal being probably the best selling business book of all time. Who has read The Art of the Deal? Yeah, most people. Most everybody. I jokingly say but I mean it \u2013 the Bible tops it by a long way. I say that. I say that. Said it the first time in Iowa. People liked that. But it\u2019s true. Nothing tops the Bible. But the Art of the Deal \u2013 great success. Many books \u2013 bestsellers. Many, many bestsellers. Then I do The Apprentice. I\u2019ve never done television. I do The Apprentice. It\u2019s one of the most successful shows ever on television by the way. And NBC renewed the Apprentice. You know that. Right? For me.

I mean, honestly I had a great relationship with NBC for 12 years. We had many, many, you know number ones and The Apprentice continues to do great. You know, last season you know how well it did. So they wanted to renew it for many, many shows. In fact, Mark Burnett called up. You know Mark Burnett. He did Survivor, Apprentice.

By the way, I think I\u2019m going to win the Hispanic vote and I think \u2013 you know, in Nevada, I won the Hispanic poll. They love me. I love the Hispanic people. Incredible energy. Incredible people. I love the people. I have so many \u2013 I have thousands that work for me and thousands and thousands over the years and have worked for me. They\u2019re great people. And I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to win\u201d. And a lot of the Hispanics that are here legally, they don\u2019t want people coming in illegally. You know it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. So there\u2019s this poll that comes out. I think it was in South Carolina where we\u2019re way up and Lindsey at 4% and he\u2019s the Senator. I\u2019m at 30%. So I wrote him a note, \u201cCongratulations. I\u2019m only beating you in your home state by 26 points.\u201d So anyways, who cares. But they did something that nobody reported. They say, \u201cOh but do people like Trump?\u201d By the way, this election is not going to be like. I think I\u2019m a nice person. I love people. I want to help people. Women\u2019s health issues to me are very important. To Jeb Bush it wasn\u2019t important because he didn\u2019t want to fund them. And then he said, \u201cOh, I misspoke.\u201d But you know, I really want to be a nice person and I am a nice person. But I think it\u2019s actually going to be an election based on competence. We\u2019re tired of being like the patsy for everybody. I really do. I think it\u2019s time. But in the poll, this was the Monmouth poll. Big poll. Highly re \u2013 \u201cIn another act of political magic\u2026Trump managed to flip his favorability rating from negative\u201d \u2013 nobody wrote this by the way. Nobody said it. Nobody reported it. \u201cFrom negative to positive.\u201d This is an exact quote. I have like this photographic memory so I don\u2019t need \u2013 but I want to be sure because if I used the word \u201cthe\u201d incorrectly, they\u2019ll say, \u201cHe didn\u2019t \u2013 \u201c \u201cFavorability rating from negative to positive in one poll during the span of a month\u201d. A feat that Monmouth University\u2019s Patrick Murray\u2019s highly respected pollster called \u201castounding\u201d. Called it \u201castounding.\u201d Nobody else wrote about it. \u201cThat defies any rule in presidential politics that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said this highly respected man. Murray, the director of the polling institute, said he flipped it from 20% to 52% in one month and he said that he\u2019s never seen that before. And you know what? That\u2019s because people have heard me and they say \u201cYou\u2019re such a nice person.\u201d No, they want \u2013 they say he\u2019s a man \u2013 I\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of money. I\u2019ve had tremendous success. And I don\u2019t say that braggingly. That\u2019s the kind of thinking we need in the country. I mean, whatever it is. But to me, that statement was more important than actually literally killing everybody in the poll. We were much, much higher, more than double everybody. And we are more than double everybody.

Those days don\u2019t exist anymore. You know, we\u2019re in age of Obamacare where nothing exists. By the way, we will repeal and replace Obamacare. That I can tell you. That I can tell you. But, so two weeks ago Wednesday, the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. So that if you go to the doctor\u2019s office, men and women are waiting four days, three days, one was five days. One case was five days or six days, finally got to see the doctor and the doctor excused himself because he was going on vacation. Now, you think about that. Can you imagine waiting even a day or a half a day? But these people are waiting four, five days. So the wait\u2019s now the longest in history and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re treating our greatest people and that\u2019s not right and we\u2019re going to change that. We\u2019re going to change that. We have right now \u2013 and people don\u2019t know this. You know, they see these phony statistics put out by politicians basically. All talk, no action politicians. And I mean on both sides in all fairness. You know, I\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative. But I\u2019m just as angry with the Republicans because they go to Washington, something happens \u2013 they become weak. You know, they go to Washington \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop Obamacare. We\u2019re going to stop this. We\u2019re going to do this. We\u2019re going to do that.\u201d Then they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible vaulted ceilings, and they go \u201cOh, I made it, darling, I made it. I vote for you. I vote for you. I vote for Obamacare expansions. I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do. I\u2019m in Washington.\u201d It\u2019s amazing. Isn\u2019t it amazing? Don\u2019t you agree? I won\u2019t happen to me, I promise. And if it does, you can let me know about it. But it won\u2019t. I promise. I promise. But you know, they show those phony statistics where we\u2019re 5.4% unemployment. 5.4%. The real number. You know, I actually saw a number it could be 42%, okay, believe it or not. But when you think about it, we have 93 million people that are right now out of the labor force. 93 million people. Of the 93 many of these people want jobs. And they quit looking. So if you\u2019re looking for a job and you can\u2019t find it and you stop for a while \u2013 you know, after a while you sort of like \u201cIt\u2019s not happening. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d I don\u2019t know what they do. But they stop. They are considered statistically employed. Okay? So, we have 93 million people out of the labor force. I mean, think about it. It\u2019s hard to believe. We have 50 million people in poverty. These are very new numbers. 50 million people in poverty. Taking our money. Japan\u2019s taking our money. Mexico is beating us at the border and on trade. By the way, they\u2019re killing us on trade. You know that. In fact, you just lost a big car plant to Mexico in Tennessee. Remember? Recently front page Wall Street Journal. A plant that you were going to have\u2026 You know this is a movement, folks. This is not like maybe even about me. I don\u2019t want it to be about me. This is about common sense. It\u2019s about doing the right thing. One of the things that came out in the poll, which was really amazing. Some of the polls, I mean, hey, in Iowa, we\u2019re leading big. Those are great people. We just left Iowa. We had such an amazing evening. 4,000 people in a room that never had that many people and it was a happening. We just left Alabama, which was unbelievable. 31,000 people in a stadium, and it was supposed to pour. And it did. It poured the minute my speech \u2013 that\u2019s like luck. That\u2019s from God. The minute the speech was over, we got it and it poured. We had 31,000 people and it was the most unbelievable. And the poll just came out in Alabama, leading big in Alabama. Leading big in Iowa. Leading tremendously big in New Hampshire. Great people. Leading really big in New Hampshire. Leading big in Florida. How about Florida? I have a governor. We have a low energy governor and we have a Senator and we\u2019re leading big in Florida. How do you do that when you have a Senator who\u2019s sitting, you have a governor who\u2019s been there for eight years and Trump \u2013 ? I love Florida and I\u2019m there a lot.

And I guess we\u2019re live on CNN, we\u2019re live on so many different things. It\u2019s always difficult. You know, when you\u2019re always live, you\u2019ve got to change up your speech. You can\u2019t make the speech over and over\u2026 The other candidates don\u2019t get covered live ever, except for the debate. So you know, they had 24 million people on the debate. Now they think when the new numbers come out they\u2019ll be even substantially higher than that. So I would\u2019ve said they would have had a million or two. So I say they have 24 million people. And I say, well now the second debate, which is on CNN \u2013 that was on Fox, maybe I should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity. Does that make sense? All to charity. All to charity. When I said that to the writers at Time Magazine, they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story. And I said, you know, and I sort of thought I said it off the record but they put it in Time Magazine. So now \u2013 maybe should I ask for charity, maybe a nice Nashville charity and American Cancer Society and AIDS research \u2013 so many of this \u2013 there\u2019s so many good \u2013 Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 you know, there\u2019s so many things going on. Maybe I should ask for a lot of money or I\u2019m not showing up. You know, it\u2019s interesting. So they\u2019ll get 2 million \u2013 a million to 2 million people at the debates. You know, they\u2019ve been doing them for a long time. They don\u2019t do great, especially the early Republican debate. Like you know the expression \u2013 it draws flies? That\u2019s what it draws. So this was one of the biggest shows in the history of cable television. I think it might have been the biggest in terms of political in the history of cable television. Naturally I took full credit for it, which in all fairness I should. I should. So bottom line I think I might ask for a lot of money for charity but you know. But I did say is it a little hokey if I do that? Maybe it\u2019s not so nice. So what do you think? Should I do it or not? Maybe not. I don\u2019t know. Here\u2019s the thing. If I don\u2019t do it, CNN just makes a lot of money. I don\u2019t care about CNN. Honestly. No, they\u2019re going to make a lot of money. They just shut off their camera. They\u2019re actually very nice. But they\u2019re going to make a lot of money and, you know, it\u2019s something we should consider. So we\u2019ll all consider it together. But coming over today, I saw that they were having the illegal immigrants come in and somebody mentioned the term the DREAMERs having to do with children and, you know, the dreams of children. And these are people who come over to the country and they\u2019re DREAMERs. And I said, \u201cWhat about our children?\u201d Why can\u2019t our children that are in the country, why can\u2019t they be the dreamers? Nobody ever talks about that. No, no, nobody ever talks about that. You know, we talk about the DREAMERs, we talk about illegal immigrants, who by the way are treated better than our vets. You know, our vets are incredible. No, no, the illegal immigrants in many cases\u2026are treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have \u2013 our wounded warriors are \u2013 these are the greatest people we have. And another thing nice about being able to make speeches without having to hire some guy to write and keep writing and reading it and put a teleprompter then say, \u201cGood morning ladies and gentlemen. Nashville, it\u2019s wonderful \u2013 \u201c you know, is that I can sort of be very current. Okay? I can be very, very current. I can talk about what\u2019s happening. This morning on the television, they had a whole story about the Veterans Administration and the hospitals how people are waiting on lines to get in. These are our veterans. These are the people that got hurt fighting for us. Maybe we wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for them, to be honest with you. I mean, that\u2019s possible too. They had a story this morning on Fox, on CNN and a number of them where the veterans are just treated terribly and they showed a desk where there\u2019s supposed to be people behind this desk and they showed this desk and there\u2019s nobody there. And the veterans \u2013 I don\u2019t know, probably some of you saw it, the veterans are saying \u201cWhere are the people?\u201d And then, they said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d And they said, \u201cThis happens all the time.\u201d There was not even \u2013 nobody even there! And two weeks ago on Wednesday, they had the longest wait in the history \u2013 in the history of the Veterans Administration for people wanting to see a doctor. When I go to a doctor, if I have to wait like 9 minutes, I\u2019m like \u201cGet me \u2013 \u201c I\u2019d go crazy. It\u2019s true. Remember the old days when the doctor used to come to your house?

So, years ago \u2013 many years ago \u2013 like I hate to say 40 but I won\u2019t say 40 but close to 40, I came to Nashville. Did you ever hear of a company called Genesco? Genesco. Right? So, they were based in Nashville, Tennessee, and they owned the Bonwit Teller department store chain. And I was a young guy and I came from Brooklyn in Queens, and I wanted to go into Manhattan. And I went into Manhattan and I did the Grand Hyatt Hotel and I did some other things that were good. But the thing I wanted more than anything was Fifth Avenue between 57th and 56th Street, which is called the Tiffany Location right next to Tiffany. And that\u2019s what I wanted. I wanted that piece of property so badly. I shouldn\u2019t say that because you\u2019re not supposed to want things like that so badly. God will get angry at me, right? But I wanted it so badly and the company that owned it was Genesco based in Nashville, Tennessee. And I came in and I came to Nashville, and I met with the heads of Genesco who were really great people actually. And they were having a lot of difficulties. There were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything. And I convinced them to sell me the land and the building. And I bought the Bonwit Teller store Fifth Avenue from 57th to 56th street surrounding Tiffany. I bought all the air rights and then ultimately I bought the air rights from Tiffany and I built Trump Tower. And to this day it\u2019s one of the great buildings of the world and it\u2019s one of the great successes. And I love country music and I went to the Grand Ole Opry while I was here. And I just had such an incredible experience. And when it came down to speaking because we could speak at a lot of places \u2013 you know, when you\u2019re leading in every poll, they sort of want you. When you\u2019re not leading in the polls, like so many of these guys, they don\u2019t want you at all. And we\u2019ll talk about the polls in a second. But I had a lot of choices for this morning, and I guess I could have also gone and played golf like the President does all the time, right? But I decided let\u2019s do this. And I really chose Nashville because the experience is one of my \u2013 it\u2019s not my biggest deal but in terms of a deal it\u2019s so important and it\u2019s been such a great \u2013 from the day I built it it was a home run.

But the 24 day period \u2013 that doesn\u2019t start, that clock doesn\u2019t start ticking for a long time. For a long time. So that could be forever. So if they\u2019re doing something, believe me, by the time we get there \u2013 ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Mobile, Alabama \u2013 Part 9"}, {"text": "Well, you know, it\u2019s sort of interesting\u2026CNN does this big report that came out last week that I was leading in the poll. So it\u2019s a poll. And everybody says why don\u2019t I have a pollster. What the hell do I need a pollster? Everyday I wake up there\u2019s another poll. Right? You know, they pay these guys like $100,000 a month and they can\u2019t function because unless they go and have it vetted with their pollster, they can\u2019t talk. And I say, \u201cWhy do I need a pollster when everyday there\u2019s a new poll and they give like 30 pages? I don\u2019t have to get a pollster. What the hell do I need it?\u201d But CNN did this very expensive, very well-done poll. It\u2019s only well done because I was leading by a lot\u2026And they had leadership. I was way ahead of everybody. They had actually I was very good in \u2013 you know the thing I\u2019ll be great at\u2026and I\u2019ll do very well at it \u2013 military. I am the toughest guy. I will rebuild our military. It will be so strong, so powerful and so great. It will be so powerful and so great that we\u2019ll never have to use it. Nobody\u2019s going to mess with us, folks. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody\u2019s going to mess with us. So, I look at the various things to do with our country. And by the way, one of them, boy, we\u2019re going to take care of our vets. Right? Right? They did a poll but they did a poll on like who\u2019s one of the most popular with the vets? I was the most popular person. They like me. And I love them. Because you know why? Because for 35 years, these Senators and these \u2013 other than Jeff, of course. I take Jeff. But these Senators, these Congressmen, these people in Washington, including Presidents, they have done nothing for the vets. They have done nothing. And we\u2019re going to take care of our vets. But so they do this poll, and in the poll, I scored really high marks on almost  everything other than \u2013 they thought I wasn\u2019t a nice person. They said who\u2019s the nicest and I was pretty low on that part. And I\u2019m a nice person. But who cares? A woman came up to me and she said, \u201cI\u2019m not choosing \u2013 you\u2019re not nice enough to be President.\u201d I said, \u201cYou know what? This is not going to be an election based on a nice person. It\u2019s going to be based on a competent person. We\u2019re tired of the nice people.\u201d So, I won on the economy. I won on jobs. I won on leadership by massive numbers. Like massive. You\u2019ve seen it. I won on all these categories. I said, \u201cWhy do we need an election? We don\u2019t need an election. These are such important categories.\u201d But I have had an amazing experience because from the time I announced almost \u2013 other than the first week. That was a rough week. They were hitting me. But the press, which is by the way largely very dishonest. I have to say this. The political media \u2013 I actually think that the political media is less popular than Congress. Can you believe it? And Congress has almost no rating. And in all fairness, \u2018cause look at all those cameras. They\u2019re all live and they\u2019re trying to shut off the camera right now. But you know what? They\u2019re all live. And so many live cameras. \u2026But I will say this. The media is very dishonest but there is a certain group that are fantastic people and every once in a while I\u2019ll get an honest story and I love it. I cherish those stories. They\u2019re not often. But I cherish those stories. \u2026They really started treating me much better. Don\u2019t forget, when I first ran, I said you know it\u2019s amazing. Went to a great school. Excellent student. Smart guy. My uncle was a professor at MIT who was a smart guy. You know, good smart guy. Good family. Do we believe in the gene thing? I mean, I do. Right? You know, I do\u2026 But then I went out and built a tremendous fortune and great company. I did the Art of the Deal and many books that were bestsellers. The Art of the Deal is one of the biggest selling \u2013 maybe the biggest selling \u2013 business book of all time. I did The Apprentice. We love The Apprentice. Tremendous. NBC hates me. You know, NBC hates me because they renewed The Apprentice and I said, \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m not doing it. I\u2019m running for President. I\u2019m going to make the country great again.\u201d They actually came up to my office and the top people \u2013 great people from NBC \u2013 and they said, \u201cPlease, please\u201d\u2026They said \u201cWe had already renewed the show.\u201d They had sold most of the advertising. They renewed the show. I said I\u2019m going to run and I\u2019m going to make our country great\u2026 ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Mobile, Alabama \u2013 Part 8"}, {"text": "Boeing does business with China.

I\u2019ll never eat them again. No, Nabisco closes a plant. They just announced a couple of days ago in Chicago. And they\u2019re moving the plant to Mexico. Now, why? Why? Why? Have you heard? My favorite story is with Ford\u2026 So Ford \u2013 great company. They\u2019re building a $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico. Now, they\u2019re closing up places all over the United States. They\u2019re building this massive factory in Mexico. So I went to this great school. I was actually \u2013 you know, I was totally still am really smart. I went to this great place \u2013 the Wharton School of Finance \u2013 hardest school to get into. Even then it was hard to get into. The hardest. But I went to this great business school and I get business. And I fully understand. Really good at this stuff. So they\u2019re building a $2.5 billion plant. They\u2019re going to close up factories in the United States. They\u2019re going to go and build this plant, they\u2019re going to sell cars, they\u2019re going to sell them back to us, they\u2019re going to sell them. Where does that help us? Tell me. Explain. Explain. There\u2019s no tax. There\u2019s no nothing. There\u2019s no nothing. So we\u2019re closing plants here. They\u2019re building this massive plant in Mexico. Another plant. Also another big foreign car company. There was a plant being built. It was all set to get started. They were going to announce it in Tennessee. You read about it. And this was a couple of months ago. Wall Street Journal. All set to get started. All of a sudden, Mexico took it away. And now it\u2019s not going to be built in Tennessee. It\u2019s going to be built in Mexico. So Ford is building a plant\u2026I give myself this position. And I say \u201cLet\u2019s assume that somebody else becomes President\u201d. Wouldn\u2019t that be horrible? Wouldn\u2019t that be horrible? So let\u2019s assume somebody else becomes President. Let\u2019s assume a very low energy person, very, very low energy. So low energy that every time you watch him, you fall asleep. \u2026Yeah, Hillary too. So let\u2019s say Jeb becomes President\u2026Not good. Not good. First thing\u2019s that\u2019s going to happen \u2013 like I said, your school\u2019s going to hell. People flow over \u2013 but forget about that. So let\u2019s say that Jeb doesn\u2019t want this plant build. So they\u2019re going to call him \u2013 the head of Ford \u2013 and they\u2019re going to say, \u201cMr. President, we want to build it.\u201d He\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t want it built.\u201d The next day or the next hour, he\u2019s going to get a call from the lobbyists and the special interests and his donors and they\u2019re going to say, \u201cHey Jeb, we gave you $8 million of your $120 million that you raised. We gave you $8 million. We want that thing done. You can\u2019t do that to our people.\u201d \u201cOh, well, okay, I\u2019ll approve it.\u201d It\u2019s going to get done. Okay? The plant will get built and that would be it. Now, let\u2019s take Trump as President. Okay, is that better? Here\u2019s the simple question: Who would you rather have negotiating with China, Japan, Mexico, any other? Trump or Bush? Actually, ah, what a group. What a group.

And you know, last week and I said this and I\u2019ve been saying bubble for a long time. You\u2019ve been hearing it. Last week, they devalued their currency and we\u2019re having a lot of hard times because of what they did. And when I hear devaluation of the Chinese currency \u2013 you know the word, the sucking action. That\u2019s a sucking like the vacuum cleaner. I hear the sucking action. Two things happen. Two things get sucked out of us. Our jobs and our money. Now, think of it. China sells us our product, takes our jobs, takes our base, does our manufacturing for us, and we owe them $1.4 trillion. That\u2019s like a magic act. I call it the magic act in reverse. We owe them money. Japan \u2013 and Japan is back. They have Abe, who\u2019s the new prime minister. And Abe is really smart. I mean, he\u2019s smart. I met him one time. He\u2019s sharp. He\u2019s negotiating against Carolyn Kennedy. Carolyn. And I was watching 60 Minutes \u2013 I\u2019ll give you guys a plug \u2013 I was watching 60 Minutes and they\u2019re doing a feature on Carolyn Kennedy and she\u2019s very nice. You know why I like her? Because Ivanka Trump likes her. My daughter likes \u2013 anybody that my daughter likes, right? Anybody my daughter likes \u2013 we love Ivanka. So, what happens is that they\u2019re doing a feature and they said \u201cHow did you become Ambassador to Japan?\u201d And with Japan, the Ambassador is a very important position because we negotiate. You know, you need somebody sharp. We need a killer. Right? A smart killer, not a dumb killer because there are plenty of dumb killers too. You need somebody sharp. So they said \u201cHow did you get the Ambassadorship?\u201d She said, \u201cWell\u201d \u2013 and this is pretty close. You can check it out. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. I wanted a job and I had nothing to do. So I went to the White House and I said, \u2018Could I have a job? Do you have anything for me to do?\u2019\u201d And they said, \u201cHow would you like to be Ambassador to Japan?\u201d And she said, \u201cReally?\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe she got it. And then they showed the rest of the show as her being wined and dined by Abe and all of these killers. Wined and dined. She\u2019s being feted at dinner, at this, and lunches and breakfast. She\u2019ll do anything they want. Anything. So I have the smartest, toughest, meanest, in many cases, the most horrible human beings on Earth. I know them all. They\u2019re killers. They\u2019re negotiators. Some are nice people. Very few. Some are nice people. But I will put the meanest, smartest \u2013 we have the best in the world. We don\u2019t use them. We use political hacks, diplomats. We use people that don\u2019t have any business ability. We use people that have never done a job. \u2026You know, like as an example, Carl Icahn, did anyone ever hear of Carl? He\u2019s an unbelievably brilliant tough businessman. So I called him. I had dinner with him two nights ago. I said, \u201cYou know, Carl, I\u2019m doing pretty well. I\u2019m leading every poll.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing great.\u201d He can\u2019t believe it either. And I said, \u201cIf I ever get there, I want you to oversee the negotiations with China and Japan.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d He\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Remember when I said somebody has blood come out of her eyes with hatred? Right? Well, he had blood coming out of it; he will do it. He is an unbelievable negotiator. An unbelievable negotiator. And I know others. I know the best. I know the worst. I know the ones that are overrated. I know the ones that you\u2019ve never heard about or read about that are better than all of them. But Carl\u2019s one of the greats. I mean, he\u2019s very famous. He\u2019s very rich. And he would love to do it. He\u2019d love to give back. And he knows what\u2019s happening. They\u2019re ripping us. So they send their stuff over here. And actually, somebody the other day said \u201cWhat China has done to the United States is the greatest single theft in the history of the world.\u201d Isn\u2019t is an interesting statement? We\u2019ve rebuilt China. We\u2019ve rebuilt China. So you know we have free trade. The problem with free trade is when you have free trade, very important, you need competent leaders. That\u2019s the one problem with free trade. I like free trade. I\u2019m a free trader. The problem is you need great negotiators, great leaders. We don\u2019t have that. So we\u2019re getting killed by everybody. I use these three or four countries. We don\u2019t make good deals. Everybody\u2019s killing us. So we will have unbelievable deals. A friend of mine is a manufacturer, and he\u2019s trying to do business with China. And what he\u2019s going \u2013 and he\u2019s a great manufacturer. Makes great products. Better than what they did. They don\u2019t want him sending his stuff. And he calls me and he goes, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s impossible to do business. I can\u2019t get my product \u2013 they\u2019re dumping stuff over here, comes in by the ship load.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. I can\u2019t get my product \u2013 \u201c Finally gets a product in there and they charge him a massive tax which they call a tariff because it sounds a little more sophisticated, right?

All because they want to be so politically correct. They actually called and said, \u201cOh, we\u2019ll get it back on soon. We\u2019ll get it back on soon.\u201d You know, in a case of a couple, they said \u201cTrump loses NASCAR\u201d. It was all over the world. A friend of mine called. You know, because I opened with a strong statement, meaning illegal immigration \u2013 we\u2019ve got to solve the problem. So all over. One day it was NASCAR. \u201cTrump loses NASCAR.\u201d I said, I don\u2019t have a deal with NASCAR. It turned out that I lost NASCAR \u2013 you know what they did? They rented a ballroom at Trump Doral. Can you believe it? That was my loss. They had a ballroom. And by the way, I kept their deposit and rented it to somebody else. The next day \u2013 I didn\u2019t even know I had a deal with them. It turned out they had in one of my places. They\u2019re out. The next day \u201cESPN severs ties with Trump\u201d.

A golf outing at one of my courses in Los Angeles. Can you believe it? This was my big deal. And this was all over the world. I mean, the press. I don\u2019t know. Maybe they didn\u2019t get it. Maybe they don\u2019t get it. I was very disappointed though with Macy\u2019s. You know, shirts and ties. It\u2019s not a big deal.

He\u2019ll never file because he\u2019s probably not as rich as people think.\u201d I said, \u201cActually, one of the reasons I want to run is because I want to file my financials because they\u2019re so good.\u201d Because it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. So I have like about 102 pages or 98 pages of stuff and they have all these boxes \u201cover $50 million\u201d, \u201cover $50 million\u201d.

Now, recently I ordered 4,000 television sets. I\u2019d like to order them from here. Like the hats made in America. Can you believe it? I was able to find a guy. I had to do that because you know these hats are hot as a pistol. You know that. And they\u2019re made in America. And I\u2019m going to give you your book. Believe me, I haven\u2019t forgotten about you. But they\u2019re made in America. But the other day and now I see today it\u2019s sort of pretty hot on the news that our very dear friend North Korea is acting a little bit rambunctious again. So, I ordered 4,000 television sets from South Korea, whether it\u2019s Samsung or Sharp or LG or any of them. They\u2019re all made in South Korea. I paid a fortune and they\u2019re wonderful. And they\u2019re wonderful people. They\u2019re making a fortune. We don\u2019t \u2013 do we have anybody who makes television sets in this country? I almost like don\u2019t think so, right? So they\u2019re mostly made \u2013 other than Sony, which has lost its way, prices are too high \u2013 but they\u2019re mostly made in South Korea. So now I see North Korea is acting up. So I see that we are sending ships and we\u2019re getting our troops ready. We have 28,000 troops over there. And we\u2019re getting ready just in case\u2026We\u2019re going to fight, we\u2019re going to protect. We get nothing. We get nothing. What do we get? We get nothing. Saudi Arabia \u2013 and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much. But you know, Saudi Arabia makes $1 billion a day. A day. That\u2019s \u2013 in all fairness, that\u2019s before the oil went down a little bit. But that\u2019s okay. These are minor details. But, let\u2019s say they were, let\u2019s say they\u2019re making a half a billion [$500 million] a day. That\u2019s not so bad, right? We get nothing. And they wouldn\u2019t be there without our protection. Even Germany \u2013 Germany\u2019s a power. Who has a Mercedes Benz? Anybody? A lot of people. They\u2019re a power. They pay us nothing. We defend the whole world. All you have to do \u2013 and we want to be nice. Somebody said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s like the mafia defense.\u201d I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, okay? The mafia\u2019s not so stupid.\u201d All right? They said, \u201cThat\u2019s terrible to ask for money.\u201d No, they said it. They said that\u2019s terrible. \u201cHow can you possibly ask for money to defend a country?\u201d I mean, tell me, tell me, how crazy are we? Now, we\u2019re sending our ships, we\u2019re sending our everything. We got \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what. Those 28,000 troops that we have right now on the border between North and South Korea. That\u2019s dangerous territory. They\u2019re in harm\u2019s way. They\u2019re in harm\u2019s way. And we get nothing. We get nothing. Other than they\u2019re a good competitor. I mean, they compete with us. They take our trade. We lose a fortune with them. We lose a fortune with China. We defend Japan. You know, we have an agreement with Japan where if somebody attacks Japan, we have to come to their rescue. But if we get attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us. Do you think that\u2019s a good deal? That\u2019s sort of like Sgt. Bergdahl. Has anybody heard of Sgt. Bergdahl? The traitor. No, no, the traitor. I call President Obama the five-for-one President. We get Sgt. Bergdahl, a traitor, who by the way six people at least that we know of, six people were killed trying to get this guy back. Six people \u2013 they went after him. They wanted to get him back. So we get Sgt. Bergdahl and they get five people that they desperately wanted for years that are right now back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody including us. How stupid are we? How stupid are we? And you know, the reason we have crowds \u2013 and no matter where I go \u2013 the other night, we\u2019re in New Hampshire, we had some \u2013 New Hampshire was so incredible. The crowd. You saw it. You know, every time I go on television it\u2019s got to be live. It\u2019s live. I said, \u201cOh, can I have a rest please?\u201d Tonight it\u2019s live on Fox. Who likes Fox? I like Fox. It\u2019s live on CNN. Who likes CNN? And it\u2019s live on MSNBC. Well, they\u2019re still working. But I said, \u201cHow come it always has to be live? Why can\u2019t they just cover me like anybody else where they go the next day and they show a little clip?\u201d Every time I speak, it has to be live. It\u2019s ridiculous. But it\u2019s okay. Right? We have to suffer with it. But look, the reason I have this really incredible enthusiasm \u2013 and I really appreciate you especially with this weather and this heat and everything else \u2013 but the reason I have it is because I do know what I\u2019m doing.

Thank you for the work you\u2019ve put into the immigration issue. I\u2019m really impressed with your plan. I know it will make a difference. And this crowd shows a lot of people agree with that. Congratulations! Welcome and God bless. So, I go around and I see so many people and I\u2019ve been treated so well by the people. And you know, we\u2019re leading in every poll. We\u2019re leading in just about every state, including Alabama. Big. We\u2019re leading in Florida. Could you believe it? We\u2019re leading big in Florida. And you know, it\u2019s really amazing. I said, \u201cWell Florida, I love Florida.\u201d It\u2019s a great place, right? Right. But Florida \u2013 we have a governor and we have a sitting Senator and I\u2019m killing them. How do you explain that? Obviously they\u2019re not doing a very good job because that shouldn\u2019t be happening. But we\u2019re winning in Florida, Pennsylvania, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas. And then, nationally, we\u2019re just absolutely way ahead of everybody else. In fact, you know, if this were another country, we could maybe call for an expedited election. Right? I would love that. Can we do that? Can we do that? I\u2019d like to have the election tomorrow. I don\u2019t want to wait. So, the reason that I think we see this receptivity is that I know the game better than anybody. I\u2019ve been on the other side. You know, I was totally establishment\u2026Was handing\u2026millions of dollars to these characters all the time, right? I was like the fair haired boy. Do I look fair haired? But I know the game. I mean, I understand it. And so many people have come up \u2013 lobbyists. I said I don\u2019t want money from lobbyists. But recently, last week, a man comes up who\u2019s a good guy. I know him\u2026I said I don\u2019t want your money. I don\u2019t want your money because I don\u2019t know maybe I\u2019ll rethink it. Should I rethink it? Take it. You know what I should do? How about this? How about if I take his money but in the end, I screw him and don\u2019t do anything for him. Is that okay? Can I do that? You know, because I built a great business and I felt sort of stupid. I say I don\u2019t want your money. Can I take it please? I promise I won\u2019t do anything for him. I told him, I said, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t want your money because in two years when you come to see me about something I\u2019m not doing it unless it\u2019s good and unless it\u2019s going to make America great again.\u201d Right? Right? But I\u2019m going to have to rethink it. I think I\u2019m going to rethink that because I think I should take a lot of money \u2013 are we allowed to give it to charity or something? I don\u2019t know. Just take it. Just take it. So what happens is these guys come up and I\u2019m lucky. You know, everybody said he\u2019s never going to run. Okay? You know that. Right?

There\u2019s always the Art of the Deal and that\u2019s the real one; that\u2019s the original. That\u2019s when they use real paper right?

We can\u2019t hold this. This is crazy, what\u2019s going on.\u201d And then we went to the convention center and they could have 10,000 people and we\u2019re all set and we\u2019re excited. And the next day they said, \u201cToo many people. We can\u2019t put them in.\u201d So we came here. We came here. You know, today if you noticed, we have a stock market not doing so well. We have a country not doing so well. We\u2019ve been saying it for a long time. We have politicians other than the few politicians that are with us tonight \u2013 well, exclude them. But we have politicians that don\u2019t have a clue. They\u2019re all talk; they\u2019re no action. What\u2019s happening to this country is disgraceful. And you know, when I announced I was running for President, I brought up the subject of illegal immigration. And I took a lot of heat \u2013 that, I can tell you. Rush Limbaugh actually said incoming \u2013 \u201cHe got more incoming than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d And two weeks later, everybody was apologizing to me. They saw that I was right. Between what happened in San Francisco to incredible Kate and her family is such an incredible family, Jamiel [Shaw], and so many people have been so badly hurt. The other day in California last week, a woman 66-years-old, a veteran, was killed \u2013 raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed by an illegal immigrant. We have to do it. We have to do something. We have to do something. \u2026You know, if it rains, I\u2019ll take off my hat and I\u2019ll prove once and for all that it\u2019s mine, okay? \u2026The people that built this country. That\u2019s what we have here. I mean, the people that built the country. Great people. So we\u2019ll start with a little talk on the illegal immigration \u2013 what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re going to stop it. We\u2019re going to build a wall and it\u2019s going to be. You know, it\u2019s amazing. The politicians 10 years ago, 15 years ago, they all wanted a wall. But it never went. It never happened. Because somebody didn\u2019t want it. Probably a lobbyist. You know, all these guys like Bush and like Hillary Clinton, they\u2019re all taken care of \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you know \u2013 it\u2019s true. No, but when Hillary has $60 million and when Jeb Bush who\u2019s totally in favor of Common Core, weak on immigration \u2013 right? Very weak on immigration. Wants to let people come in. Although now, he is using anchor baby. You know, he put out a memo \u2013 \u201cYou cannot use anchor baby.\u201d Now, because I used it, he\u2019s using it. Politicians. But when they have \u2013 in his case, $114 million \u2013 in Hillary\u2019s case, she\u2019s got $60 million. Now, I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s going to make it to the game. What do you think? I\u2019m not sure that she\u2019s making it to the game. Some bad things came out today. You know, those classified \u2013 you know the word classified. You know, they\u2019ve destroyed Gen. Petraeus over less and nothing seems to be happening here. So it will be very interesting to see what happens ultimately. But, we have right now and I just got these numbers today. I said \u201cWhat are they?\u201d 7.5% of all of the births in this country are illegal immigrants. Okay? Can\u2019t afford it. And they\u2019re supposed to stay. Now, I turned out to be right. The 14th Amendment. You know, I had these guys \u2013 \u201cYou can\u2019t change the 14th Amendment. It will take so long.\u201d On that I agree. But you know what? An act of Congress \u2013 the 14th Amendment \u2013 I was right on it. You can do something with it and you can do something fast. You can do something fast. So we have 300,000 babies a year. 300,000 that you have to take care of. We all have to take care of. And you know, in the case of other countries including Mexico, they don\u2019t do that. It doesn\u2019t work that way. You don\u2019t walk over the border for one day and all of a sudden we have another American citizen. It doesn\u2019t work that way. Mexico doesn\u2019t do it. Other places don\u2019t do it. Very few places do it. We\u2019re the only place just about that\u2019s stupid enough to do it. So, I decided to run \u2013 I\u2019ve gotten an amazing reception. I have to say, has this been crazy? I mean, it\u2019s been wild. I\u2019m a non-politician. The other day, I served jury duty. Right? I told you \u2013 they had \u201coccupation\u201d. I refused to put down \u201cpolitician\u201d. But I will say this: We have a great politician here. We have a man here who really have been \u2013 he\u2019s the one person I sought his counsel because he\u2019s been so spot on, he\u2019s so highly respected. Has anybody ever heard of Sen.

Let me tell you, I\u2019ve been dealing with politicians all my life. They\u2019re fine. They\u2019re wonderful. They\u2019re all talk. They\u2019re no action. They\u2019re selling this country down the tubes, and they\u2019re easy to deal with. Believe me. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n You know, the paper\u2019s not relevant.

The little ones. The big ones. I\u2019m leading. So importantly to me I\u2019m leading in Iowa. Because when people look at Scott Walker, his state has a $2.2 billion deficit. He thought \u2013 you know, he was telling people \u2013 his growth is terrible in terms of the state, and there\u2019s tremendous dissention all over the state. But they said they were going to have a big surplus of $1 billion. Well, the $1 billion surplus is a $2.2 billion deficit. And nobody was willing to say it but me. And I didn\u2019t want to say it. I would not have said it until he attacked me. Then I said, \u201cThank you very much\u201d then I said it. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Why, do you think they\u2019re getting along good right now? Putin can\u2019t stand Obama. Nobody \u2013 who likes Obama? I\u2019m talking worldwide. He\u2019s not getting along with anybody. And I\u2019ve said it. Hillary Clinton was the single worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. The world collapsed around us while she was Secretary of State. Now, in my opinion, Kerry might be worse because he\u2019s making a deal with Iran that is so bad and so dangerous and so incompetent and stupid that it will have grave consequences \u2013 grave consequences.

We\u2019ve spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost, wounded warriors who I love all over the place, and he said we have to prove that we have skin in the game. I think it maybe one of the dumbest statements I\u2019ve ever heard. Skin in the game. We don\u2019t have to prove anything. First of all, the Iraqi officials are a bunch of crooks, if there\u2019s even an Iraq which I don\u2019t think there is. Iran is taking over Iraq. It was one of the dumbest things ever. And I think what happened because I understand psychology, I think his brother probably said \u201cHey, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d That was his war and he looks very bad. So Jeb Bush tried to push back. But when he said we have to prove to Iraq that we have skin in the game and we\u2019ve lost all of those lives and all of that money, I think he should apologize to the families of the people. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n These are not people that are doing it because they like the color of his hair, believe me. These are highly sophisticated killers. And when they give $5 million or $2 million or $1 million to Jeb, they have him just like a puppet. He\u2019ll do whatever they want. He\u2019s their puppet. Believe me. And with me, I had yesterday a lobbyist called me up. It\u2019s a friend of mine. Good guy. Smart as hell. He\u2019s \u2013 for his client, I don\u2019t blame him. He said, \u201cDonald, I want to put $5 million into your campaign.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t need it. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no, I want to put $5 million in.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want it because when you come back to me in two years and you want help for a company you\u2019re representing or a country that you\u2019re representing, I\u2019m going to do the right thing for the people of the United States and I don\u2019t want to have to insult you. So honestly, I appreciate it. I don\u2019t want your $5 million.\u201d I\u2019m turning down so much money.

It\u2019s peanuts. We can\u2019t sell beef. So we do about 20% to their 100%. So I said it in an idea on the way over. I said, \u201cTell Japan that\u2019s okay. Everything\u2019s fine. We\u2019re going to cut your orders down to 20%. Let it match.\u201d Let it match. Simple deal. Simple deal. And I had another idea that\u2019s also very simple. When Mexico \u2013 and you remember when Fidel Castro took over, the opened his prisons and he sent everybody over to the United States and we accepted them and it was hell. We didn\u2019t send them back. We accepted them. In a much, much, much more sophisticated way, Mexico is doing that to us because why would they want to have a prisoner like these two horrible people that hurt so badly \u2013 destroyed \u2013 but hurt so badly the Shaw family and Kate\u2019s family. Why would they want to have them in jail for 40 years, paying for it? So I had an idea\u2026The one with Kate came over five times. In my opinion, he was pushed out by Mexico. They don\u2019t want him. They don\u2019t want to take care of him. Why would they want to take care of him? And believe me, Univision, which I\u2019m suing by the way for $500 million because they broke the contract, but Univision is doing the work of the Mexican government. And I don\u2019t blame them actually. I respect Mexico. I don\u2019t blame the Mexican government. I just wish our people were smart. Like they\u2019re really smart doing that. They\u2019re sending them to us and we\u2019re either putting them in jails or letting them go free, which is even worse. But we have to do something. So, I have an idea. I said every time an illegal comes to this country through the border because Mexico was pushing them over, remember that. And by the way, unbelievable people are coming. A lot of people that are illegal are great people. Just let\u2019s get it straight \u2013 they don\u2019t want to give it straight because the press are liars. They\u2019re terrible people. They\u2019re terrible people. Terrible. Not all of them but many of them. So here\u2019s an idea. So, Mexico is sending them. And by the way, they\u2019re coming from all over the world including the Middle East. Why not? Come on in. We\u2019re stupid. We\u2019ll take care of you. We\u2019ll pay. Get sick, we\u2019ll take care of your hospitalization. What kind of a plan do you want? So I had an idea. I think it\u2019s good. Every time Mexico really intelligently sends people over, we charge Mexico $100,000 for every person they send over. Now, they make so much money that that\u2019s peanuts. It\u2019s not a lot. Could have made it much higher but I\u2019m nice. I\u2019m in a good mood today. We charge Mexico $100,000 for every person. You\u2019ll see that it\u2019ll start to stop because that starts to add up. It starts to add up. We have to secure our borders. We have to do something to take back our country. I mean, don\u2019t kid yourself folks, what took place today, even by the dishonest press, what took place today is being seen all over the world. Look at all those cameras back there. This is being seen all over the world. People know. You know, it\u2019s a term I haven\u2019t heard for years but I was thinking about it\u2026It\u2019s a term that I haven\u2019t heard for years but I really think it applies now more than maybe ever before and that\u2019s the term \u201cthe silent majority\u201d. Have you all heard that? You don\u2019t hear it. When people start cutting up their credit cards at Macy\u2019s and won\u2019t go to Macy\u2019s anymore, when all of these things \u2013 and that\u2019s a big story but nobody wants to write it. That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t care about me. But when you see the kind of power that the silent majority has and the silent majority is a problem. They want to go out. They want to lead a good life. They want to work hard. They want to have their family. They don\u2019t want to be involved in coming here and waiting on a line for hours and hours and coming in and listening to Trump. But the silent majority is back, and we\u2019re going to take the country back. And we are going to make America great again! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!

And everyone said, \u201cYou can\u2019t keep the oil. This is a sovereign country. You can\u2019t keep the oil.\u201d I said, \u201cKeep the oil. We\u2019re in there now. You blew it.

They\u2019re competing with me. Can you believe it? They\u2019re renovating this building; they\u2019re building a hotel. They\u2019re wealthy. They have the oil. And I said, \u201cKeep it.\u201d And great criticism. \u201cTrump says keep the oil. Well, that\u2019s a sovereign country. Isn\u2019t it a horrible thing to say?\u201d These are stupid people we have leading us. So ISIS, believe me, I would take them out so fast, it would be \u2013 have to do it, have to do it. See, I think they overplayed their hand. I actually think they made a big mistake. When they started, like you take James Foley. So great. Such a great guy. I got to know his parents\u2026I met the parents; they\u2019re very interesting\u2026 They did the beheading and then they\u2019ve done other \u2013 I said, \u201cYou know, they\u2019re making a big mistake, ISIS, because if they wouldn\u2019t have done and if they wouldn\u2019t keep doing, we wouldn\u2019t have cared. We could have been gone. But you can\u2019t, not when you see what they\u2019re doing, you can\u2019t.\u201d Had they not done those things, the level of violence \u2013 we\u2019re like living in Medieval times. You know, when you hear of Medieval time, you always think we were all civilized. It\u2019s a jungle. It\u2019s horrible out there. But when they started doing the beheadings, they really \u2013 I think they made a mistake but not with Obama because he\u2019s weak and he\u2019s ineffective and he\u2019s not respected. Not respected. So here\u2019s the problem. Here\u2019s the kind of deals we make: James Foley is dead. Great guy. Amazing guy. Amazing parents. We have Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor. So we negotiate for Sergeant Bergdahl, a no-good traitor. Six people were killed trying to find him. Six young in this case men went out to try to get him; six of them never came back. Six people died and we have Sergeant Bergdahl. And here\u2019s our deal. This is just like the stupid deal that we\u2019re making with Iran on nuclear. This is just like everything else we do \u2013 the deals we make with China, the deals we make with Mexico. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. So we get Bergdahl, a no-good traitor. Frankly, I\u2019d re-negotiate deals every once in a while. Not too often but I\u2019d send him back, and if they don\u2019t want him, send him back anyways. I want to re-negotiate that. They get five killers that are right now back on the battlefield, trying to kill everybody, including the people in this room. And these were the five people that they most wanted. So I call Obama the five-for-one President. Who would make that deal? Now, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because he\u2019s a bad person\u2026Who would make a deal like this?

They\u2019re armor-plated Humvees. You can imagine what they cost.

Some Wall Street guys, they\u2019re brutal, they\u2019re miserable. You wouldn\u2019t want to go out to dinner \u2013 they\u2019re terrible people. I love them. I know the best. I know people that are totally overrated. They\u2019re not good like they think and like the press thinks. I know people that you never heard of that are better than all of them. I would take one, put him in charge of Japan. Good luck. You know who\u2019s our primary representative right now? Caroline Kennedy. You know how she got the job? 60 Minutes \u2013 she went to the White House. She said \u201cI\u2019d love to have a job. I have nothing to do.\u201d They said, \u201cHow would you like to be the Ambassador to Japan?\u201d She goes, \u201cReally?\u201d And Abe from Japan, who\u2019s a killer, he\u2019s great. He\u2019s already knocking the hell out of the yen, by the way, which makes it even more impossible for us to compete. And he\u2019s wining and dining her, and I watch it all the time \u2013 wining and dining and just doing a number on our country. A friend of mine is a great excavator. That\u2019s what he does. He digs foundations. He digs lots of dirt \u2013 Earth. But he\u2019s a great excavator. Big. And he always bought Caterpillar. And he calls me up recently and he goes, \u201cI\u2019m a little depressed.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI just put in a big order for machinery, for excavating equipment.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s good. Did you buy Caterpillar?\u201d \u201cNo, I bought Komatsu.\u201d I said, \u201cYou bought Komatsu?\u201d It\u2019s fine. I mean, it\u2019s a well-known brand. I said, \u201cYou bought Komatsu. Why?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause Japan has so devalued the yen\u201d \u2013 brilliant, smart, these are smart people \u2013 \u201cthat it made it impossible.\u201d \u2026So he ordered Komatsu instead of Caterpillar.

By the way, Jamiel\u2019s sister is here too and she told me the story that when Jamiel saw the boy, saw the boy laying on the sidewalk dead, this incredible young man with such a future, Jamiel laid down on the sidewalk and started pounding the sidewalk with his hand and badly damaged his hand. Badly, badly. He couldn\u2019t understand it. He couldn\u2019t believe it. Just an amazing guy. I mean, just an amazing guy. And he wasn\u2019t being heard. He wasn\u2019t being heard. And the only reason I heard him was because he was talking on a show and he was mentioning how badly they\u2019ve all been treated. And then you have in San Francisco, a beautiful young woman, Kate, and killed by somebody that just pleaded innocent. First pleaded guilty. Now he has a good lawyer and went into court and pleaded innocent. And they\u2019ll be playing around with him for about 15 years in court and probably he\u2019ll get off too. It\u2019s a horrible thing that\u2019s going on with our country. And these are two people that should be alive. And these are people that shouldn\u2019t have been in this country. They flow in like water. And I love legal immigration. I love it. I love it. I think it\u2019s great. My wife is a legal immigrant. I mean, she went through a whole long process. It\u2019s not easy, and we should maybe make it easier and faster, which I think is fine. And we\u2019ll have great people come in, and we\u2019ll have them come in from all countries \u2013 Mexico \u2013 everybody, every place. These are great people. And you know, one of the things that I\u2019ve seen \u2013 because this has been an amazing week \u2013 and you know, it\u2019s been like an incredible week because I thought I was going to be the jobs person because every poll \u2013 CNN did a poll the other day \u2013 I\u2019m killing everybody on jobs. I\u2019m killing everybody on leadership. You know, it\u2019s like funny. You know, I went through these different categories \u2013 the only thing I\u2019m not killing, a lot of people don\u2019t like me. I said what difference does it make. This is about competence. Somebody said, \u201cYou win on leadership by far. You win on absolute economic, financial \u2013 anything having to do with the economy. You\u2019re like lapping the field. Much, much higher than anybody else. But they said, but a lot of people don\u2019t know whether or not they like you.\u201d I\u2019m actually a nice person. But I actually said if I\u2019m winning in all these categories, why are we even going through primaries? Hillary Clinton is going to be a horrible President. It\u2019s horrible. If she even wins her own primary, which I don\u2019t know. And by the way, just so you understand, even then press will say \u201cThis crowd today blows away anything that Bernie Sanders is having.\u201d That I could tell you. But if you think about it, Hillary Clinton was the worst Secretary of State in the history of our country. The worst. The world blew up around her. Our enemies are a disaster and they hate us more. Our friends are all gone. They\u2019re all gone. They\u2019re all sort of like \u2013 we don\u2019t get along with anybody. Everybody is ripping us off, whether it\u2019s Russia or China.

I called him up about 7 p.m. He wasn\u2019t home. \u201cHey, where are you?\u201d \u201cHey, we\u2019re coming home from the mall. We missed the bus. You know, we\u2019re safe, dad. We\u2019re safe.\u201d Because he knew that\u2019s all I was \u2013 I said, \u201cMake sure to call me. I would have came and got you.\u201d So I started calling him an hour, calling him an hour. I said, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d He said, \u201cRight around the corner, old man.\u201d You know, that\u2019s what he called me. And I was like, whew. I felt really good inside. I thought, \u201cWhew, he made it home.\u201d You know, I live in LA. You know, so, he had a little brother \u2013 eight-years-old. He got his clothes on. We were getting ready to go get some track spikes. He had a track meet that Friday. This was Sunday night. So you know, a couple of minutes later, gunshots. I mean, really loud, really crispy. So I knew. Oh my God, it was outside my house. Called his cell phone. Didn\u2019t answer. Man, I knew. I went outside and looked down the street. There he was laying on the street dead. You know, I couldn\u2019t believe it. Even right now when I say it, you know, I don\u2019t believe it. You know, he was laying there with his eyes closed towards the house. Looked like he was sleeping. Looked like he was sleeping. But his body \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen a dead body before \u2013 and his body was obvious. He was dead. And I remember, you know, it\u2019s hard situation to go through. After all that, I found that the guy who killed him was illegally in the country. Come on. You know, that\u2019s \u2013 I thought somebody black did it\u2026Found out that the guy was on his third gun charge. Now, you have somebody illegally in the country on their third gun charge. He\u2019d been arrested three times already. He\u2019s in jail again. Assault with deadly weapon. Battery on a peace officer. They gave him eight months in the county jail. Eight months. Let him out four months early. Now, this was 18th Street gang member in the gang database. He\u2019s been arrested twice for gun charges, stabbed people, put schools on lockdown. Just really violent, you know. And these were the ones that Obama said they wanted \u2013 the violent ones, the gang bangers, the ones with guns. He was released on a Saturday night without any supervision. Sunday night he was in my neighborhood. My son coming home from the mall. You know, he went to my neighbor\u2019s house. That\u2019s why he was in my neighborhood. To make a long story short, he went to my neighbor\u2019s house, knocked on the door; he wasn\u2019t home. On the way back to his car saw my son coming. Ran right over there. He was on the phone with his girlfriend when he heard the guy ask \u2013 well, my son was telling his girl, \u201cOh, something is going wrong. This ain\u2019t right. What should I -\u201d You know that kind of stuff. And she was like \u201cRun, run!\u201d It was too late. She heard the guy say, \u201cWhat sect you from?\u201d And then he killed him. Shot him in the stomach. You know, one of the neighbors saw it. Shot him in the stomach with a .45. So you can imagine. A .45, a 17-year-old kid, shot him in the stomach. While he was one the ground, pointed to the corner, he had his hands up like this and he shot him through his hands. They thought he had three \u2013 they thought he had three gun shots because his hand was really badly damaged, a bullet wound in his stomach, and one in his head. The coroner said he was on his back, went like this, and he shot him through his hands into his head. Now, we hear all the time \u201cMichael Brown. Hands up, don\u2019t shoot.\u201d Now, that was really hands up, don\u2019t shoot. I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t saying anything because he just had a bullet wound in his stomach. But if you could imagine your child \u2013 I tell people all the time when they protest or they protest Mr. Trump, what you have to do is so soul-search. Put yourself in my shoes. Think about your child laying on the street dead. Your mother, your wife, your father, anybody. We\u2019re not designed for that, you know?  Then to find out someone illegally in the country did it. So when I found out \u2013 you know, I\u2019m going to move on to Donald Trump. When I found out Donald Trump was running for office, I watched him because everybody likes Donald Trump. If it had nothing to do with the presidency, you want to see what he\u2019s got to say. So I looked. I saw what he was saying and he was talking about saving the country. People, my friends were calling me. Liberal friends calling me, \u201cTurn the TV on. Donald Trump is talking about helping America.\u201d You know, I turned it on and I saw it. When I saw it, I was so happy. For the first time in seven years, I feel hope, real hope. You know, I felt real change. You know? And one thing Donald Trump showed me when he came out aggressive like he did at that, he can weather a storm. You know? We need somebody who can weather a storm. No one else, no one else can lose that kind of money and still be able to do what they\u2019ve got to do. You know what I mean? You know, I tell people all the time: The only difference between me and Donald Trump is that he doesn\u2019t care what\u2019s going on because he had the resources. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t have nothing. I have nothing to lose. You know what I mean? So it\u2019s like a team. You know, they can\u2019t stop us. And you know, we really got to get him in here. He loves America. You know, I would tell you, I\u2019m serious, if Donald Trump wasn\u2019t a real deal, I wouldn\u2019t have come around him because, you know, my son was murdered, so I don\u2019t trust nobody. You know, I mean, I think everybody, you know, if you\u2019re not against illegal immigration, you\u2019re my enemy. I can\u2019t help that. That\u2019s how I feel. My son was murdered. You have to understand that. You have to understand \u2013 what would you expect from your government? What would you expect from a politician that\u2019s running for office? What would you expect if your son was dead, your daughter, your mother? What would you expect from him? You would expect for him to go out there and fight for us. Who do we have? You know, he\u2019s the only one \u2013 he\u2019s the only that\u2019s talking about saving our country. All the Republicans \u2013 we were going to be bamboozled. Donald Trump exposed them all. Because they were all going to say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to save the border\u201d and they did nothing. Now, they\u2019re after him. So what are they going to do for us? Nothing. We have to trust Donald Trump the way you trust your mom, your dad, as you were growing up. You don\u2019t have to believe everything they believe. You don\u2019t have to do whatever they say. But you have to trust them. That\u2019s your mom, that\u2019s your dad. It\u2019s somebody you have to believe in. Like I always say when people don\u2019t want to hear what I have to say, ask yourself what would you do if somebody killed your kids?

And I said, \u201cOh that\u2019s too bad. How can I be tied with this guy? He\u2019s terrible!\u201d He\u2019s weak on immigration. You know, the sanctuary cities. Did you know that he had five of them in Florida while he was governor? Can believe this? I didn\u2019t know that \u2013 I just \u2013 five of them. He\u2019s totally in favor of Common Core, meaning your children in Phoenix and other places are going to be educated by bureaucrats from Washington, who for the most part just want to pick up a check. Give me break. And he\u2019s in favor. I don\u2019t see him as a factor and I know it\u2019s the Bush name, which you know has gotten us into lots of wars. I mean, in all fairness, not the greatest.

How can I be tied with this guy?\u201d But I\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019m going to bring up a man to just a few words. His son was viciously and violently shot by an illegal immigrant. His son was a star athlete, a star student. He applied to Stanford and many great colleges. He would have been \u2013 he could have gone anywhere. And I met Jamiel on television about a week ago. I see this guy. He\u2019s mentioning my name. I said, \u201cOh no, not again\u201d because I figured he\u2019s killing me like everybody else. Right? My wife said, \u201cNo, I think he\u2019s saying some really good things.\u201d I said, \u201cI doubt it.\u201d You know, they\u2019re hitting me left, right. I said, \u201cI doubt it.\u201d But I turned it up and he said, \u201cThe only man that\u2019s sticking up for us is Donald Trump.\u201d This guy is great, and we were at the news conference with his mother and his sister yesterday and it was one of the most incredible things. So I\u2019d like to introduce to speak a little bit about his son and how incredible his son was and how his son should be here with us. I mean, his son should be alive and he should be in one of the great colleges and he should be maybe someday in the NFL. But he won\u2019t be because an illegal immigrant shot him violently. And this guy is the best guy. He\u2019s become my friend. He\u2019s been with me for a few days. And just say a few words about your boy. Jamiel Shaw\nThank you. Just \u2013 my name is Jamiel Shaw. My son was named Jamiel Shaw, II. He was shot dead in the street by an illegal alien or should I say someone in the country illegal. And he was a good kid. I\u2019m sorry. He was a good kid. He was a good kid. He was \u2013 we thought we did a good job. You know, when he was five-years-old, I started training him to get him ready. My goal was to get him ready for the ninth grade, which was high school. And we know high school football is big time. You know you have to really start early. We were doing the pop warner. We were doing everything. And I was on his case 24/7. I was one of those hands-on dads like my dad was. He was hands-on. You know, he was hands-on and the belt on. You know, I respected my father. I was scared of him more than I was scared of the police. So I made sure I could do nothing wrong. And I wanted my son to be the same way. I didn\u2019t want to have to spank him. I want him to do what I say because it\u2019s the right thing to do and he want to make it in life. So we trained, we trained. We got to high school and he just really. It was unbelievable. I was starting to getting scared. It\u2019s too good to be true. You know, he was three time MVP. He was in the eleventh grade. All three years MVP. Player of the Year. All City. I\u2019m sure people here know what I\u2019m talking about with their kids went through that kind of stuff. You know the hard work and the sacrifices that the kids have to do. And the parents \u2013 you know, my weekends was his. You know, I had to go and take care of everything. So one Sunday we went to Pasadena at a training clinic for Division I prospects. So he was like wow. He was like, \u201cMan, dad, we did it.\u201d So to make a long story short, on our way home, he asked me if he could go to the mall and of course I didn\u2019t want to. But you know, \u201cAll right, man. What time are you going to be home?\u201d He said \u2013 I said, \u201cWell, be home by 7 p.m.\u201d It was like 3 p.m., you know, still early.

That\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about. That\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about. So, I just sued Univision for $500 million. With all of that being said, we have to be strong. We have to take our country back. We have to run the country properly. So, I\u2019m going to bring up a man who\u2019s a great man. He\u2019s a great, great guy. I saw him the other day on television. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s okay. You can shout. I wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here; I think so. Because I\u2019m telling you, I tell about the bad deals that this country is making. Mexico \u2013 I respect the country. They\u2019re taking our jobs. They\u2019re taking our manufacturing.

It wasn\u2019t until five days later that people started saying, \u201cOh he said something -\u201c What they don\u2019t say is they cut it in the middle of the sentence. They cut it. Because those people \u2013 many of them \u2013 not all, some are great \u2013 but many of them are very dishonest people, meaning the press. Very dishonest. Very dishonest. I\u2019ll give you one quick example because I want to bring somebody up for a second who\u2019s fantastic. But I\u2019ll give you one quick example. I say \u2013 and it\u2019s fairly standards because I believe it strongly \u2013 \u201cThe American dream is dead but I\u2019m going to make it bigger and stronger and better than ever before.\u201d Right? Right? So and I say it usually once during a speech, every once in a while. You know, I don\u2019t use teleprompters like the President and I speak from the heart. So I say \u201cThe American dream is dead but I\u2019m going to make it\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s standard \u2013 \u201cbigger, better, and stronger.\u201d Okay, so now I go home and my wife says to me, \u201cDarling, that was such a tough statement.\u201d What? I turned on the television. \u201cThe American dream is dead.\u201d Period. Cut. I said, \u201cOh, what a horrible statement.\u201d They are so dishonest. They are so dishonest. You know, what I usually do because if you really love this country, you have a very, very hard convincing people what you\u2019re doing is right and that you\u2019re really smart. And like a lot of us are really smart. I\u2019m like really smart. Went to the Wharton School of Finance. Even then a long time ago, like the hardest or one of the hardest schools to get into. Did well at the school. Came out, made a fortune. Wrote a book called \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d. Did everybody read \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d? They say the number one selling business book of all time, which I agree, but I\u2019ll say one of them because if I\u2019m slightly off by two copies, they\u2019ll say \u201cOh, Trump exaggerated.\u201d \u2026Wrote many bestsellers. Many. I think 12. So I did a lot of things. But \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d was like the number one selling business book of all time. Great. Then I do The Apprentice, became this tremendous hit. NBC was desperate to have it. Forget it. Now, they can put somebody else that lasts. Okay. So ready? And then I hear like \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t deserve to be on the same stage with some failed Senators, failed governor\u201d or something. It\u2019s sort of amazing, isn\u2019t it?

Like when I went on dates, if a woman dropped me \u2013 which happened often \u2013 I would always like to say or at least in my own mind that I dropped her. Does that make sense? So what happened \u2013 makes me feel better. So they renewed The Apprentice and I said I\u2019m not going to do it because I\u2019m going to run for President. They didn\u2019t believe me. I said, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you believe me?\u201d \u201cWhy would you give up a primetime show?\u201d Mark Burnett calls from \u2013 a great guy. Survivor, Apprentice. Great guy.

We just went to number one in the polls. So, NBC went nuts. They renewed their show and they don\u2019t have their star and everybody else failed with similar shows. And they\u2019re angry at me. So again, don\u2019t believe the inclusion. They\u2019ve got Rev. Al Sharpton working for them. Okay? He\u2019s actually not a bad guy. He\u2019s a con man. You\u2019d have to understand it. Rev. Al is a con man. You know, tells people \u201cI\u2019m going to picket you if you don\u2019t give.\u201d I mean, this guy is a con man. But I\u2019ve known him for 20 years. He\u2019s fine. You\u2019ve got to understand who you\u2019re dealing with. They\u2019ve got lying Brian Williams. He\u2019s okay. They sent me the most beautiful present a couple of months ago. Hundreds of \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t say the name because I deal with all of them \u2013 but in this case, Titleist. They sent me hundreds and hundreds of Titleist golf balls. Top of the line.

More inclusive than anybody. I then get a call. Univision. Now, Univision controls and by the way, believe me. Univision has a certain power. Now, I didn\u2019t know much about Univision. I thought they were very wealthy. They\u2019re actually not wealthy at all. They\u2019re highly over-levered. They\u2019ve got like, I think, $10 billion in debt. They have to do an IPO. Now, how stupid is this? They could have waited a couple of weeks, done their IPO, and be done. Instead, they do it early. They couldn\u2019t do it fast enough because you know why? In my opinion, it\u2019s only my opinion, the Mexican government totally tells Univision \u2013 it\u2019s about 80% of their market \u2013 totally tells Univision what to do. Totally. So the Mexican government is not happy with me, to put it mildly. But again, I respect Mexico but their leaders are too smart for our leaders because we have stupid leaders. Okay? And I\u2019ll tell you, just between you \u2013 just between this little bit of a group \u2013 thank you very much\u2026 ", "name": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Phoenix, Arizona on July 11, 2015 \u2013 Part 4"}, {"text": "So I\u2019m walking up the stairs to make a speech and I have Lundgren saying \u201cI\u2019d like to cut you\u201d because he\u2019s going to get some bad publicity, he thinks. And I walked upstairs and he said, \u201cAnd now the American dream \u2013 \u201c. And I\u2019m still talking to Lundgren, and it\u2019s like a minute and a half before I walk on stage. People said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d And I made a good speech. No notes. No nothing. And everybody was happy. And I just got cut from Macy\u2019s. And here\u2019s the bottom line on Macy\u2019s. Thousands and thousands of people are cutting up their Macy\u2019s credit card. Thousands. Then I get a call from NBC. Now, let me tell you about NBC. No, no, I got to tell you. Hey, look, I love the people at NBC. We had a tremendous success with The Apprentice. And they renewed The Apprentice. See? I give up a lot. You\u2019re going to see how much money I made with The Apprentice come Wednesday or Thursday when I do my filing. Seriously. It\u2019s a very lucrative \u2013 you know, it\u2019s great when you have a big television show. It\u2019s like, you know, you\u2019re a movie star; you get a lot of money. Right? Not that much but a lot. But you\u2019re going to see very impressive numbers. So NBC calls me \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019d like to see you.\u201d Now, they don\u2019t care about inclusion. They were talking about inclusion. You know, they write their press release. So, I read this and I say, \u201cThis is incredible\u201d. But they called me and a couple of months ago the head of NBC comes to see me. And the head of NBC\u2019s boss \u2013 I don\u2019t want to mention names because they\u2019re really good people. They\u2019re friends of mine although I\u2019ll probably never speak to them again either. And you know, the head of NBC\u2019s boss \u2013 that\u2019s Comcast because they own NBC. So I get a call \u2013 the head of reality for NBC, the head president of NBC, and the head of everything \u2013 the head of Comcast. And they come to see me a number of months ago, \u201cPlease do The Apprentice. Please.\u201d They won\u2019t deny it. They won\u2019t deny it. I said, \u201cI can\u2019t. I want to make America great again.\u201d I\u2019ve done The Apprentice now for 12 years and it\u2019s a great show. For 12 years. There have 14 or 15 copies of The Apprentice. Every one have failed. Every single one. I mean, I could give you names but I don\u2019t want to embarrass people. Nah, give you a couple of names. No, nice people. Mark Cuban did one called The Benefactor. It was a disaster. Richard Branson did one. Great guy but it didn\u2019t work out. Tommy Hilfiger, who I love. A tenant in my building. Great guy. Didn\u2019t work out. Hiltons did one. Martha Stewart did one for us. Did one for Mark Burnett and Donald Trump. Martha Stewart. She\u2019d just got out of the can. No, it\u2019s true. She\u2019s hot as a pistol. You know, they showed her coming out. You know, she\u2019s got the whole thing with the whole outfit that she\u2019s wearing. The whole thing. I said, \u201cWhat a great idea.\u201d So we actually did The Apprentice done by us. It wasn\u2019t even a copy. It was called The Apprentice. Within a couple of shows it was over. It was over. So I must have something, right? I must have. So here\u2019s the story. NBC sees this. I mean, they\u2019re smart people. So NBC comes to my office and they want me to do The Apprentice so badly. And what do I do? I said, \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m going to run for President.\u201d And I said, \u201cBecause of equal time \u2013 \u201c Now, you know what equal time. Such a stupid law. Obama can go on television all day long and be President and run for office. But if I have a television show, what happens is everybody running for office would have to be able to do The Apprentice. Equal time. So you\u2019ll have a good guy named Rick Santorum. You\u2019ll have all these guys. You\u2019ll have somebody who used to head up Lehman Brothers \u2013 the governor from Ohio. Headed up Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers almost took down the world. He was a managing partner. I think he\u2019s a nice man. I don\u2019t know. But I know if you\u2019re the managing partner of Lehman Brothers, Lehman Brothers almost \u2013 you\u2019re not looking too good. You know. But all of these guys, they would have to be given two hours in primetime television on Monday or Sunday night. I don\u2019t think so.

Many, many people from Mexico \u2013 legal. They went in the old fashioned way. They\u2019re legal. Many, many people from Mexico work for me. And over the years, thousands of people \u2013 Hispanics \u2013 have worked for me. And many, many work for me now by thousands. They\u2019re incredible people. By the way, nobody ever says that. Nobody ever says that. They always cut that out. And I\u2019ll go a step further. I respect Mexico greatly as a country. But the problem we have is that their leaders are much smarter, sharper, and more cunning than our leaders, and they\u2019re killing us at the border and they\u2019re killing us in trade. They\u2019re killing us. And every once in a while I\u2019ll see a rally and it\u2019s put up by the Mexican government in my opinion. People come in. They\u2019re so perfect. They\u2019re like central casting. And you know how long the rallies last? Like about 12 minutes. They go home. But when you do \u2013 I\u2019ve said this often. It\u2019s very, very hard for a very successful person \u2013 and I\u2019ve heard it from the time I was a little boy \u2013 to run for President or even political office. And I find it and I have headlines everyday. \u201cESPN drops Trump\u201d. A friend of mine in Paris called. \u201cOh Don, it\u2019s too bad about ESPN.\u201d You know what they were doing? They rented my golf club for a day. They put up a big deposit. I took their deposit. And then I rented it to somebody else. I made two for the price of one. No, it\u2019s true. Then the next day all over the world, \u201cNASCAR drops Trump.\u201d NASCAR. NASCAR. And then friends of mine call up from Europe. Headlines \u2013 NASCAR. \u201cDon, it\u2019s too bad about NASCAR. I feel so \u2013 \u201c You know what that one was? They rented a banquet hall at Trump National Doral in Miami for one evening. I took their deposit \u2013 I took their deposit. And you know what? I just rented it for much more money than they were paying. So it\u2019s two for the price of one. You know, I may make money running for President. It\u2019s very interesting. Then all over the place, I hear Macy\u2019s. Now, Macy\u2019s hurts because the head of Macy\u2019s I thought was a great friend of mine \u2013 Terry Lundgren. Nice guy. He called me up, and I\u2019m in New Hampshire and I\u2019m getting ready to go on to make a speech. Sort of interesting. It\u2019s like 6:30 in the evening, and I get a call from Terry Lundgren of Macy\u2019s. And the speech is packed. It was a house. It was supposed to be in the house. They didn\u2019t have enough room. They had 300, 400 people and they never thought this was going to happen. They thought there were going to be 30 like this. This is a little larger but the same thing proportionally. So my phone rings \u2013 my cell phone, and it\u2019s Terry Lundgren of Macy\u2019s. And the man on stage is getting ready to introduce me. And he said, \u201cAnd you know, we have Donald Trump \u2013 the American dream\u201d and blah, blah, blah, blah \u2013 everything. And my phone rings during the introduction. I\u2019m going to be going up there like in a minute. And he goes \u2013 \u201cDonald, hi.\u201d He\u2019s like my best friend. I said, \u201cTerry, what\u2019s your problem?\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re very controversial.\u201d He said \u2013 and I\u2019m supposed to be going up. I\u2019m supposed to make a speech. I got all these people. And by the way, cameras \u2013 just like all these cameras \u2013 you have all these cameras \u2013 we\u2019re on live television all over the place like we are now.

It\u2019s going to destroy the building. It\u2019s been amazing.\u201d And outside, sadly, we have thousands of people that can\u2019t get in. So you know real estate. You know real estate. I want to thank everybody. You know, last night \u2013 and a lot of you saw it on television \u2013 it was actually carried live \u2013 we had an amazing event and a very sad event. And yet, very beautiful. Because the word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration. We have to. We have to. We have a situation that\u2019s absolutely out of control. We have incompetent politicians, not only the President. I mean, right here in your own state, you have John McCain. I just hate to see when people don\u2019t have common sense, don\u2019t have an understanding of what\u2019s going on, or perhaps don\u2019t want to know. Maybe it\u2019s campaign contributions.

We are going to make this country so great again. We are going to work so hard. And I will say this: When we had our event last night, I saw hardened veteran reporters who were crying. You had to see this. People that I\u2019ve known for a long time that I don\u2019t even like \u2013 they\u2019re not good people. How are you doing back there? And one in particular, tears are streaming down his face and I\u2019m saying \u2013 I don\u2019t believe what I\u2019m seeing. I didn\u2019t think he had a tear in him. And some of the people that spoke were absolutely amazing. One, their child was killed by an illegal immigrant, shouldn\u2019t have been here. And this began for me \u2013 it\u2019s very interesting because when I started and when I announced \u2013 don\u2019t forget, everybody said, \u201cHe\u2019s never going to run.\u201d Right? Then they said very strongly \u2013 you know, these are very knowledgeable people; they don\u2019t know anything. Then they said, \u201cHe\u2019ll never file his FEC paper.\u201d I filed that two weeks ago. They said, \u201cOh, wow.\u201d Then they said, \u201cHe\u2019ll never file his financials because he\u2019s not as rich as people think.\u201d And they get filed during this week. And by the way, some of the other candidates will not be filing from what I hear. Okay? And when they filed, the number is actually much higher than anybody ever knew. And I\u2019m not saying that to brag. I\u2019m only saying that because that is the kind of thinking our country needs. We need thinking where trade deals with China, with Japan, with India, with everybody. We\u2019re getting ripped. We\u2019re being taken apart piece by piece, slowly. Slowly. China laughs at us. They laugh at our stupidity. They laugh at our incompetent politicians. They have geniuses negotiating for them. We have people who don\u2019t have a clue; they don\u2019t have a clue.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I\u2019m Pete Saenz. I\u2019m the mayor of Laredo, Texas. And we\u2019re excited to have Mr. Donald Trump here in Laredo, Texas. It has provided us an opportunity to present to Mr. Trump and his entourage what Laredo is all about. You know, Laredo is the number one land port in the nation. We do \u2013 Laredo, per se, does over 40% of the Mexican trade. Laredo is known for obviously transportation. You could see the big trucks behind us and logistics. We are \u2013 NAFTA has been very good to us. We\u2019re excited about that. We also have oil and gas production at the county and it also provides a revenue to us. Mr. Trump has brought up certain issues \u2013 about the immigration issue in particular. We, at least I feel personally, that immigration reform is required, is needed. We need protection in the border area. We need to secure the border but we also need other elements. You know, obviously, the immigration act or bill. So with that in mind, it\u2019s a pleasure to have Mr. Trump. The excitement that he brings is also very on the plus side for our city, and we appreciate all of the attention but we know that the attention comes from really through this gentleman here. Mexico is booming, absolutely booming. And Jesus \u2013 the city manager \u2013 and Pete have done an amazing job right here. But a lot of what\u2019s happening here is because of the fact that Mexico is doing so well. Just doing beyond what anybody ever thought and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good for the United States but it\u2019s good for Mexico\u2026 Question:\n[Inaudible]\n So I have a great relationship. Over the years, thousands and thousands of Hispanics have worked for me and now work for me, and the relationship is very good. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible] You keep saying there\u2019s danger but the crime along the border is down. What danger are you talking about? Question:\nHave you seen any evidence here to confirm your fears about Mexico sending its criminals across the border? And in fact, as you know, the border patrol was the one that invited me. I think most of you have that invitation. We sent it. The border patrol invited me and then they cancelled because frankly they don\u2019t want to get involved\u2026The reason they invited me was because of the tremendous problem and the tremendous crime and all of the things that I\u2019ve been talking about. So they invited me and then at the last moment \u2013 I mean, we were virtually in the air \u2013 and they said, \u201cWe can\u2019t get involved.\u201d And I heard they got those orders from Washington. Question:\nWhat evidence specifically have you seen? Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Come on, Jesus, say a word. This man \u2013 I\u2019m going to steal him to run something for me. He\u2019s fantastic. Laredo City Manager Jesus Olivares:\nThank you, Mr. Trump. Welcome everybody to the city of Laredo. You know, this is one of the greatest cities on the border and we\u2019re a vibrant city. And as Mr. Trump mentioned, you know, the trade that we have here with Mexico, this is where the rubber meets the road. And all of you can see it right behind us, this is where all the trade comes through that Mexico and the United States have in common right here. And not only that but this is where it goes to the rest of the world. And I\u2019ll tell you, what we wouldn\u2019t be where we are if it wouldn\u2019t be for the support that Mayor and members of the City Council that are also here with us \u2013 Mr. Councilmember [Juan] Narvaez and Councilmember [Alejandro] Perez \u2013 we are very fortunate to have the support that they provide us in order for this city to be such a great city and the number one inland port in the country. Thank you. Question:\n[Inaudible]\u2026The way to secure the border is to build a long wall? Laredo City Manager Jesus Olivares:\nWell, that\u2019s a federal issue and we have our comments. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary at this time. I think there\u2019s other ways that we can work together with the federal government. I think right now, we have a process that we work together with Border Patrol, CBP, and everybody to be able to get some of these things done. The relationship that the city of Laredo has with the federal government with all the law enforcement agencies is a tremendous one. Thank you. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n Question:\nWhat will you actually do to change the illegal immigration? \u2026You have to create \u2013 you have to make the people that come in, they have to be legal. Very simple. Question:\n[Inaudible]\n They want to do their job. That\u2019s why they invited me. They invited me. I didn\u2019t come here. The border patrol invited me because they got such a problem. They want to be able to do their job. If they can\u2019t do their job, believe me, they\u2019re unhappy. They want to be able to do their job. Question:\n[Inaudible] Are you still in favor of a wall across the entire border? By the way, the wall will save you a tremendous amount of money, but you absolutely \u2013 there are areas you have to have the wall. Question:\n\u2026Threats from El Chapo? Question:\nFrom El Chapo? The drug cartel leader? Question:\n[Inaudible]\n The best way to win is for me to get the nomination and run probably against Hillary. Hillary is the worst. Look, easily, she\u2019s the worst Secretary of State in the history of our country. She\u2019s going to be beaten and I\u2019m the one to beat her. And I will take jobs back. And the reason I won with the Hispanic vote and I win all over with the Hispanic vote because they know I\u2019ll take jobs back from China, I\u2019ll take jobs back from Japan, and every other country that\u2019s killing us. I\u2019ll bring the jobs back. And you know, the Hispanics are get those jobs and they\u2019re going to love Trump and they already do.

Well, they\u2019re petrified and they\u2019re afraid of saying what\u2019s happening. You know, they\u2019re the ones that invited me. They wanted to give me an award.

There\u2019s nothing more important than what I\u2019m doing. And I\u2019m the one that brought up the problem of illegal immigration. And it\u2019s a big problem. It\u2019s a huge problem. You folks know it better than anybody. And you look at the crowds outside. We have big crowds that are all screaming in favor of Trump. Everybody wants me because they want the problem fixed.

Question:\u00a0 Well, I think Rick Perry did a terrible job as the governor of Texas where the border security was terrible. Now, your new governor of Texas I think is doing a great job \u2013 Abbott. Gov. Abbott\u2019s doing a great job. But Rick Perry, honestly, I don\u2019t think he even understands\u2026 Oh, he\u2019s following in my lead, absolutely.

They\u2019re having parades. They\u2019re honoring him. \u2026We\u2019re like a bunch of slobs. We\u2019re like a bunch of dopes. We should have doubled up the sanctions, maybe tripled up the sanctions, sat back for about three months and let them call us. And believe me, I would have made one hell of a deal. That one\u2019s easy. That one\u2019s easy. So it\u2019s very, very sad. And a lot of people think the reason I\u2019m doing so well in polls \u2013 made a very good Iowa poll yesterday. But that I\u2019m doing so well in the polls is that when North Carolina comes in \u2013 your neighbors \u2013 and I\u2019m killing everybody in North Carolina. Hopefully, I\u2019m going to do great in South Carolina\u2026 \u2026But when I do great in North Carolina, when I do great in Nevada, which just came out and I won the Hispanic vote. I won big league \u2013 the Hispanics. I\u2019m telling you. There is something happening. You know, there used to be the expression \u2013 many of you have heard it\u2026the silent majority. There\u2019s a silent majority out there. We\u2019re tired of being pushed around, kicked around, and acting and being led by stupid people. They\u2019re stupid people. I mean, you have a President who can\u2019t just say a few words: Put the flag at half mast for the five Marines that were just killed. Why? Why? Why? I mean, think of it. How easy. It\u2019s almost like \u201cDoe he read the papers? Does he watch television?\u201d Every television. Whether it\u2019s Fox or CNN or MS \u2013 any of them. They\u2019re all talking about it. Like, \u201cOh, gee well.\u201d \u2026Just put them at half mast for a week. These people were great. They never had a chance. This gun-free zone nonsense. We\u2019ve got to stick up for that Second Amendment. This gun-free zone \u2013 these guys never, ever had a chance. And by the way, a couple of them, big, big decorations \u2013 decorated, tremendous, unbelievable, young, brilliant people \u2013 gone. They never had a chance. A gun-free zone. And they\u2019re trained with weapons. It\u2019s not like \u201cOh gee, it\u2019s not good to have\u201d. They\u2019re trained. These are the best\u2026They were sitting ducks. They never had a chance because of the stupidity. We have to get rid of that whole gun-free zone nonsense and just stop it. You know, in some of the communities, our recruiting stations and recruiting areas, they actually have civilians surrounding \u2013 can you believe this? \u2013 civilians surrounding that are armed to protect the military soldiers that are our best and finest. And they\u2019re in there and they don\u2019t have guns. So we have civilians surrounding. This is what our country\u2019s come to.

Your Medicare, your Medicaid, your Social Security.\u201d But I\u2019m the only one who knows how to do it and the way you do it is you have to make our country vibrant so that we can afford it. Right now we can\u2019t afford it. Our GDP went down in the first quarter. Like down. China went up to 7% and they\u2019re beside themselves \u201cHow come it only went up 7%?\u201d And China \u2013 one year ago it was announced, China now is the number one in the world. You know that? Economically, from the standpoint that so matters. China. It\u2019s unthinkable. We\u2019ve allowed them. But it\u2019s our money. I mean, I love Apple. But where are they made? What do they have? They have an office here and all the workers are over there. We\u2019ve got to change it around. We\u2019ve got to incentivize them so that we make Apple and all the other things, they\u2019ve got to be made here. And if China isn\u2019t treating us fairly, we have all the cards. The administration doesn\u2019t know this. If they\u2019re taxing and we\u2019re not taxing, which they do by the way, then we have to make sure that they pay a penalty and they will stop immediately. And if they don\u2019t stop, we\u2019ll get rich on receiving taxes from them. And we don\u2019t even want to bring up the word. So we\u2019re going to save your Social Security. We\u2019re going to make it strong and solid. Medicare, Medicaid, we\u2019re going to stop the waste and the abuse and the fraud that goes on. We\u2019re going to make proper deals. People mention the Iran deal as an example. What kind of a deal is this? What kind of a deal? I mean, I\u2019ve seen one-sided deals before. This is like Sergeant [Bowe] Bergdahl. We get a traitor \u2013 a no good rotten traitor like Bergdahl \u2013 and they get five killers that they most wanted in the whole world who are right now back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody, including us. Okay? What kind of a deal is this? Not good. Right? \u2026A lousy deal. But we only make lousy deals. I call Obama the 5 for 1 President. We get Bergdahl; they get five guys that they dreamed of. And that\u2019s the problem. So the Iran deal \u2013 any time, anywhere, we want to be able to inspect. They got 24 days and notice provisions and all. By the time, it could be months and months and months. By that time it\u2019s gone. But you know what irks me? Look, having nuclear. My uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer. Dr. John Trump at MIT. Good genes. Very good genes, okay? The Wharton School of Finance. Very good. Very smart. You know, if you\u2019re a conservative Republican \u2013 if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I\u2019m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world. It\u2019s true. But when you\u2019re a conservative Republican, they try \u2013 oh, do they do a number\u2026That\u2019s why I always start \u2013 went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, build a fortune. You know, I have to give my credentials all the time because we\u2019re a little disadvantaged. But you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me \u2013 it would have been so easy. And it\u2019s not as important as these lives are \u2013 nuclear is so powerful. My uncle explained that to me many, many years ago the power and that was 35 years ago. He would explain the power of what was going to happen and he was right. Who would have thought? But when you look at what\u2019s going on with the four prisoners. Now, it used to be three. Now it\u2019s four. But when it was three and even now I would have said it\u2019s all in the messenger. Fellas. And it is fellas because you know they haven\u2019t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men. So you know, it\u2019s going to take them about another 150 years. But the Persians are great negotiators. The Iranians are great negotiators. And they just killed. They just killed us. This is horrible. But I would have said at the beginning, \u201cFellas, you\u2019ve got to let our prisoners go. Look, you don\u2019t need them. You don\u2019t want them. It would send a great signal to the United States and it would make the rest of it easier.\u201d Nothing. We get nothing. We don\u2019t the prisoners. And Kerry said the other day and so did Obama \u2013 we didn\u2019t want to negotiate and complicate the negotiations. What\u2019s complicated? Say, \u201cExcuse me, we have four prisoners. We\u2019d like to have them please.\u201d Okay? \u201cOh, it\u2019s too complicated.\u201d This is crazy. Then we\u2019re giving them billions and billions and billions of dollars.

We really have to do it fast because we don\u2019t have that much time left. We have to change our mindset in the United States. Now, you know, I have a little statement \u2013 the American dream is dead. And to just show you how bad it is, the American dream is dead. But I\u2019m going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. Because the press is very dishonest. And I say always, the American dream is dead but we\u2019re going to make it bigger and better and everyone stands up and they go crazy and they applaud. And I mean it. So my wife goes the other day I\u2019m talking to her, she goes, \u201cOh darling. That was such a tough statement.\u201d \u201cWhat? What? I thought I did well.\u201d And they turned it on. They have on television \u2013 TiVo. They have \u201cThe American dream is dead.\u201d Cut. That\u2019s the end. That\u2019s a terrible segment. So I say the American dream is dead.

They don\u2019t know how to do it. And I am so tired of politicians. Nobody knows them better than me. I know them. I know them. I deal with them. If you can\u2019t get rich dealing with politicians, there\u2019s something wrong with you. Honestly. I know them. The problem is with politicians and this is almost all of them, not all of them but the problem with politicians it\u2019s perseverance. They work. They try. But they only want to keep their job. That\u2019s 99% of what they want. I get calls from Senators. Could we come and see you? You know, you have these campaign finance limits, which are actually a good thing\u2026I even tell them \u2013 Senators call up, I send them a check \u2013 it\u2019s easier. I say don\u2019t bother. They want to fly from Washington to New York. I mean, how long. Come to my office and I\u2019m allowed to give them what, $2,600 or something. I mean, like a whole day is wasted. And I say this is what they do? And that\u2019s what they do from morning \u2019till night. And if you need something later on, they win their election or they lose their election, if you need something, you call them. They treat you great, like royalty. Like royalty. And a businessman, a businessperson knows the game. And what you look at, for instance, Jeb Bush. I\u2019m not a fan of Jeb Bush because Jeb Bush is in favor of Common Core and he\u2019s weak on immigration. Those are two bad things. I think he\u2019s a nice person actually. But he\u2019s very in favor of Common Core, meaning he wants your children to be educated from Washington, D.C. by the bureaucrats. Okay? Not good. And he\u2019s very weak on immigration. And he\u2019s not a deal guy. He\u2019s not a deal maker. Who would you rather have negotiating in China, as an example? Trump or Jeb? Or Trump or Hillary? Okay, Hillary? She\u2019s another one with the tone. Isn\u2019t it amazing they both said tone the same day. It was about the tone but they both said it the same day. So I am very excited about this. It\u2019s a very interesting situation that\u2019s taken place. We had a poll come out yesterday \u2013 the Washington Post poll with ABC and it showed that I had an 11 point lead. That\u2019s faster than scheduled. That\u2019s faster than scheduled. I mean, that\u2019s the good news. The bad news is it drives people crazy. And I don\u2019t really know why. Because all I want to do is make our country great again. You know, it\u2019s like aren\u2019t we all on the same track, whether you\u2019re a liberal, a Democrat, a conservative, a Republican, or all of them? I mean, aren\u2019t we all sort of on the same track? You want to make our country great. I know people that are Democrats that love our country. I know people that are liberals, believe it or not, that love our country. And if I can make phenomenal deals with China, which I will. I will, believe me. The best negotiators in the world, I know every one. I know the bad ones, good ones, the over-rated ones, the ones that you\u2019ve never heard of that are better than all of the ones you read them all. I know them all. I wrote the Art of the Deal.

If a Republican wants, if a Democrat \u2013 I give. When I need something, I call. \u201cMr. Trump, sir, how are you? What can I do for you?\u201d I said \u201cNothing really. Be at my wedding. Make sure, please.\u201d Or whatever I want. Part of the problem \u2013 see, with me, I don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s money. Nobody has to give to me. People are sending me money anyways.

The most incredible. As shots fired and the guys we gave them to \u2013 our allies \u2013 they run. One shot goes in the air, they run. So the enemy takes over, 2,300 Humvees.

I\u2019m in the real estate business. All the time I get these listings. You know, a base, a naval base, an army base, a marine base. They\u2019re always for sale! I say how many bases can they sell? I mean, they\u2019re selling the bases. When you sell the bases, that means they\u2019re closing up. And right now, our military is the smallest it\u2019s been in decades and we need it like more than ever. And our vets are being treated worse than they\u2019ve ever been. So the waiting list. Worst than they\u2019ve ever been. The waiting list as of this morning, I just saw a report \u2013 you know, they had the big thing when they had the scandal. Because this is the most corrupt thing you\u2019ve ever seen. And this is why I\u2019m angry at John McCain for two reasons. Number one, John McCain \u2013 you\u2019ve got to remember this \u2013 he\u2019s totally about open borders and all of this stuff. And when I went to Arizona, he called these 15,000 unbelievable people \u2013 unbelievable. I know crazies, okay? I know crazies. These were unbelievable American people. And John McCain who I supported for President \u2013 I think I raised him over $1 million and he lost. So he can lose. I don\u2019t hold that against him. But I raised him a lot of money. But he called these people crazies. There were so many they had to turn like I think 1,000 or 2,000 away like they did. I hear that they had to turn a lot of the people away. Even though they have the ante rooms all over the place, they had to turn people away. That\u2019s the kind of crowds we\u2019re getting. But he said that. And today, I hear the waiting list is the longest it\u2019s ever been. I hear that it\u2019s worse than it\u2019s ever been. And two years ago, remember, in order to get rid of all of the problems they threw more money at it. But when you have incompetent people at the top \u2013 and they put in a new guy but he\u2019s not the right guy. He doesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s doing according to everybody I know. He has no clue. I know the best people. I know the best managers. I know the best deal makers. I know people that will make us so strong. I know guys that are so good as managers. A lot of times a deal maker isn\u2019t a good manager. And then a manager isn\u2019t a good deal maker. But you look at Obamacare with the $5 billion website and the wonderful former governor who\u2019s a wonderful woman didn\u2019t have clue. She didn\u2019t have a clue. It was a mess. So how do you spend $5 billion on a website for something that has to be repealed and replaced with something much better? Has to be, has to be. We have no choice. Because it\u2019s bad for the people. The premiums are going through the roof. The deductibles are ridiculous. You\u2019re never going to use it unless you get hit by a Komatsu. It\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to use it. It\u2019s true. Not Caterpillar. We don\u2019t buy them any more, remember. So this guy Lindsey Graham gets out and he\u2019s out there and he calls me a jackass. I\u2019m supposed to be \u2013 I\u2019m trying to be nice. You know, I\u2019m working hard to be nice. But every time I turn on, I have some guy that is hitting me like hard. Now, the reason that they\u2019re hitting me in all fairness is when you register zero in the poll, what the hell, they have nothing to lose, right? And then I thought to myself about Lindsey Graham. You know, I thought it was a very bad statement. You know, you build a fortune. You\u2019re a smart guy. You want to do something great for the country. I\u2019m giving up millions of dollars. I had Macy\u2019s terminate a deal because \u201cOh, Don, you\u2019re a little controversial. You\u2019re talking about illegal immigration.\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s illegal.\u201d But they had no guts. No, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true.

And they all failed. Most of them immediately. Most of them immediately. So NBC renews The Apprentice. Everyone said, \u201cWell, I thought you were running for President.\u201d I said I am. Well, they don\u2019t understand. Well, I told them I\u2019m not doing it. They didn\u2019t believe me. Mark Burnett called me and he said, \u201cThey\u2019ve given you a major renewal.\u201d They did \u2013 28 shows. 28 shows. That\u2019s a lot. You know how much money I give up by doing this. These politicians \u2013 they run and they run and they win and sometimes they lose and they keep running. That\u2019s all they do is they run. Most of them don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They just run. They\u2019re like \u2013 you wind them up and they run for office. They don\u2019t do anything when they get there. I know them better than anybody. So they say they didn\u2019t like the way that, you know, I\u2019m a little loud. I\u2019m a little too strong for them. They don\u2019t like it. And then I watch this idiot Lindsey Graham on television today and he calls me a jackass. \u201cHe\u2019s a jackass\u201d. You know, I built a company. They all said I\u2019d never run. I announced that I was going to run. \u201cWell, he\u2019ll never file his form papers.\u201d That was two weeks ago. I filed my form papers. \u201cWell, he\u2019ll never file his financials.\u201d And my financials are like, well, it\u2019s like 98 pages. By the way, a lot of these politicians haven\u2019t filed them and they\u2019re like half a page. And they still haven\u2019t filed them. I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s filed practically. A lot of these guys haven\u2019t filed. That was one of the things that you\u2019d have to do to get into the debates. So everyone figured, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll keep Trump out of the debates because he\u2019ll never file his financials because he doesn\u2019t want to see \u2013 he doesn\u2019t want people to see that maybe he\u2019s not as wealthy as people thought.\u201d Well, it turned out that I\u2019m much wealthier than people thought. I built a great company. I wanted to file if for no other reason I\u2019m a private company. I can\u2019t tell you how rich you are\u2026But who the hell knows? Nobody knows how rich I am. So now I had to file. So it\u2019s over $10 billion. Hundreds of millions of dollars. And I made $213 million filed certified on The Apprentice. Can you imagine they paid me $213 million? So you know what that means when I give up The Apprentice to run to help you people straighten out this mess that everyone\u2019s created \u2013 that the politicians and Obama have created? I mean it\u2019s very expensive and it\u2019s very everything and I don\u2019t care. And what I say about the $10 billion, it\u2019s much more than that but that\u2019s okay. I want to be conservative. When I say about the $10 billion, I\u2019m not doing that to brag. Who cares? Who cares? If you have a billion, you can live very nice. I\u2019m only kidding. Who cares? What I\u2019m saying is that\u2019s the mindset that we need as a country. We need to take back our jobs from China and other places. We need to make great deals with other countries. Saudi Arabia \u2013 I like the Saudis. They\u2019re very nice. I make a lot of money with them. They buy all sorts of my stuff. All kinds of toys from Trump. They pay me millions and hundreds of millions. But you know what? They make $1 billion a day, folks. And whenever they\u2019re in trouble, our military takes care. You know what we get? Nothing. South Korea \u2013 crazy is right. Right? Who said that? Stand up. Stand up. He said it\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s crazy. They make $1 billion a day.

I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s going to win the Hispanic vote because I\u2019m going to take jobs from China, Japan, and Mexico and lots of other places, we\u2019re going to bring them back here and they\u2019re going to work. They\u2019re going to be legal in the country. They\u2019re going to work. Everybody\u2019s going to be happy and make money. So I love the Mexican people. I love the Mexican people and I love Mexico. I really like Mexico. It\u2019s a great place. The problem we have is that their leaders are much smarter, sharper, and more cunning than our leaders. Are you shocked to hear that, by the way? Is anybody not sharper and more cunning and smarter than our leaders? Any country in the world? Do we make any good deals any more on trade? When was the last time you said \u201cOh gee, we beat China in a trade deal\u201d? Doesn\u2019t happen. \u201cWe beat Japan in a trade deal\u201d? \u2026I was in Los Angeles. I see these ships come in. Biggest ships I\u2019ve ever seen. Millions of cars coming into this country. Ships that are five times longer than this totally sold out building along with the amphitheaters by the way. The press never reports that. They never report that. But that\u2019s okay. I was actually going to bring the press, have them sit over here so they see. But totally \u2013 just the biggest ships. Cars, cars, cars. They just cut their yen. You know, they just cut their currency. Now it\u2019s going to be even harder. I tell this story. A friend of mine is a great excavator. This is what he does. He digs foundations. You didn\u2019t think I know people like that. Those are my people, let me tell you. This guy\u2019s great. He\u2019s a great excavator and he was very, very upset because his order for new excavation equipments and tractors. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t buy Caterpillar. All my life I\u2019ve bought Caterpillar and now I went to MatSu.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause Japan just cut their currency so low, Donald, that I had no choice. I had to do it. I feel so guilty. But I owe it to my wife and my family and my employees and the company that I built. They couldn\u2019t compete with it.\u201d And I said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that sad?\u201d \u2026That\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening even worse with China. They manipulate their currency better than any country in the history of the world in history. History. They\u2019re killing us. And if you want to do business with China, it\u2019s almost impossible because believe me they tax you. We don\u2019t tax because we have people that are stupid. You know, free trade \u2013 I believe in it. I believe in it. Totally. I\u2019m a free trader. The problem with free trade is you need smart people on our side. Okay? We need smart people. I could take some of the people up here. I could put them in. They\u2019d do a great job. But we need smart people. And when you don\u2019t have smart people, free trade is not a good thing because it\u2019s killing us. So I believe in free trade, but we\u2019ve got to get the right people. Now, China loves me. Who\u2019s worse to China than I am? I\u2019m constantly talking about how they\u2019re ripping us off everything else. And yet, I just signed a lease with the largest bank in the world from China. They\u2019re in one of my buildings. I sell apartments for $25, $35, $45, $12, $9 million to people from China. I own a big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco. I beat the people from China. I win against China. You can win against China if you\u2019re smart. But our people don\u2019t have a clue. We give state dinners to the heads of China. I said, \u201cWhy are you doing state dinners for them? They\u2019re ripping us left and right. Just take them to McDonalds and go back to the negotiating table.\u201d Seriously. It\u2019s true. So then they talk about the tone. You know, Hillary and all of them. And then I see Rick Perry the other day and he\u2019s so \u2013 you know, he\u2019s doing very poorly in the polls. He put glasses on so people will think he\u2019s smart and it just doesn\u2019t work. You know, people can see through the glasses. But he\u2019s got the glasses, the whole deal\u2026I\u2019d say he did a lousy job on the border. You know, the new governor, Gov. Abbott, has put in things that should have been put in a long time ago. But I see him \u2013 he\u2019s so vicious. You know, used to be a really nice guy. He used to come to see me for contributions and support. All of a sudden, he wants to show that he\u2019s a tough guy with Trump. So tough\u2026He was very nasty.

Actually I didn\u2019t read \u2013 I don\u2019t use teleprompters. I don\u2019t like it. They\u2019re too easy. Other people use teleprompters. Maybe when you run for President, you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use a teleprompter because you\u2019d find out what you\u2019re getting. Does that make sense? And very interestingly, made a speech, got great reviews \u2013 fantastic reviews. And everybody thought it was a wonderful speech, wonderful opening. Then about a week later, they said, \u201cOh\u201d. They took a statement and they dissected it and they cut out a few words and they said this. And all of a sudden. And it was very interesting. And what that sort of transformed into was the word \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d. And we brought something up that wasn\u2019t even discussed by anybody \u2013 Democrat, Republican. Wasn\u2019t discussed. The problem that we\u2019re having in this country. It\u2019s a tremendous problem with the border and border security and lack of border security and illegal immigrants. It\u2019s a huge problem. And now everybody\u2019s talking about it and they\u2019re saying I was right. And people that were criticizing me two weeks ago are calling me and they\u2019re saying \u201cOff the record, Mr. Trump, you were right.\u201d And even reporters \u2013 a couple of them called \u2013 and they \u2013 I said, \u201cWould you go on the record?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no, we don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d But we\u2019re getting great credit. And then last week as you know, we had a tremendous rally \u2013 15,000 people in Phoenix, Arizona \u2013 and it was unbelievable. And they came for a reason and it was illegal immigration. They\u2019re being decimated. They want it stopped. I want people to come into the country. But they have to do it through the legal process. And we can open up the legal process and make it go faster and all of those things. But it has to be a legal process. You can\u2019t have people just pouring into the country. So I was out there and I was taking tremendous abuse. Unbelievable abuse, actually. And people said, \u201cWould you apologize? Would you apologize?\u201d And then there were tremendous crimes that were being noted after my speech. And then you had magnificent Kate [Steinle] from San Francisco killed by an illegal immigrant who was forced across the border, back to us \u2013 in my opinion, forced by the Mexican government \u2013 back to us and that was taken place and five times back into our country. And the fifth time was not good because Kate should be with us and she\u2019s not with us. She was an amazing person from everybody\u2019s standpoint and she\u2019s not with us. And then other things happened. So many other things. And now people are looking and they\u2019re seeing what\u2019s going on. So that\u2019s become a very, very big topic \u2013 illegal immigration. And I can say in terms of setting the standard and setting the force, it would not even be discussed right now folks and it\u2019s going to be something I think that\u2019s going to be one of the hot buttons. Now, I watch as politicians are trying to claim that, and that\u2019s okay with me. You know they\u2019re all talk, no action so they won\u2019t do anything anyway. Just so you understand. They can talk all they want. I mean, I got a little dose of it. I was coming up and I see your Senator. What a stiff. What a stiff. Lindsey Graham. By the way, he\u2019s registered zero in the polls. Zero! He\u2019s on television all the time. So this morning, you know, they told me, \u201cMr. Trump\u201d, because Bush said my tone\u2019s not nice. I said, \u201cTone, we need tone. We need enthusiasm. We need tone.\u201d It\u2019s true. And actually Hillary Clinton said, \u201cI don\u2019t like his tone.\u201d We have people having their heads cut off \u2013 Christians in the Middle East. We have people that are being dunked in cages and drowned in the Middle East. We have border security that doesn\u2019t exist and it\u2019s not because of our incredible border folks. I mean, they can do the job. And we can build a wall. And by the way, Mexico can pay for the wall. Just so you understand. You know, all of these guys say, \u201cOh, they\u2019ll never pay.\u201d Of course they\u2019ll pay. If you have the right guy negotiating that, they\u2019ll pay. They\u2019re making a fortune. And I have a lot of respect for Mexico by the way. A lot of people say \u201cOh, he doesn\u2019t like\u201d \u2013 I love Mexico. And I love the Mexican people. I\u2019ve had thousands of Mexicans working for me. I sell apartments for millions of dollars to people from Mexico. They love me. They love me.

Frank Luntz: \nDid God help you do these great deals? And essentially, Frank, look, when you boil it down, we need a President that\u2019s going to be able to make deals \u2013 great deals \u2013 because we\u2019re getting killed. We\u2019re losing \u2013 our gross national product went down. Our GDP if you look at it \u2013 gross domestic \u2013 went down in the first quarter. It became negative. When China goes up 7% or 8%, I saw the other day, China went up 7%. It was like in China they\u2019re going crazy. How can it only go up \u2013 we had a negative. Think of it. We had a negative number. It\u2019s unheard of. GDP goes down fairly substantially. And I think it\u2019s going to continue to go down. That means we\u2019re getting smaller and yet we have more people many of which pour across our border by the way. We need somebody that can take our jobs back from China. We need somebody that can take our jobs back from Mexico. We need somebody that can take our jobs back because we\u2019re going to hell. Our country\u2019s going to hell\u2026We\u2019re going to hell and we need somebody that\u2019s going to be able to bring our jobs back. Frank Luntz: \n\u2026Leaders are required to set priorities. Is our economic health or our moral health more important for the next President to prioritize? Look, if I\u2019m elected President, I know everybody. They can\u2019t create jobs like me. Nobody\u2019s going to be close. They can\u2019t negotiate with China like I can negotiate. And by the way, every single other country in the world, we don\u2019t make good deals anymore. If I can make the country strong financially, it\u2019s a lot easier for the country morally. I mean our country \u2013 you look at what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re in serious trouble. Our military is \u2013 we\u2019ve sent weapons over to our so-called allies and one shot\u2019s fired and we lose 2,300 humvees, armored plated. I mean, we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. We truly don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. If I can make our country really strong, I would focus on the military. I tell you what I\u2019d focus on the vets. I love the vets. The vets are treated like fourth class citizens in this country. And that\u2019s part of the morality. These guys went out. These people went out and they fought for us and they\u2019re great people. The best people. And they\u2019re treated so badly. I\u2019ve been with vets where they say they go to a doctor\u2019s office in one of the places and they\u2019ll wait four to five days in a reception area before they can even see a doctor. That\u2019s morality too and that\u2019s very bad morality. I think your question is very good but I think they have to go hand in hand because our country\u2019s a debtor nation. We\u2019re in serious trouble. And we\u2019ve got to make us \u2013 I know it sounds a little bit rough \u2013 we\u2019ve got to make our country rich again. We have to make our country great again. We can\u2019t let other parts of the world steal our country, steal our jobs, steal our manufacturing. With that being said, the morality of this country with the right President. President Obama, I\u2019d never thought he would be a good President because I didn\u2019t think he was qualified. But I thought one thing that he would do, he would be a great cheerleader for the country. He\u2019s been horrible\u2026 I don\u2019t know if he loves America. I hope he loves America\u2026 Frank Luntz: \nIs he a moral President? But you know what? I was hoping and I thought \u2013 the one thing I thought about him \u2013 I saw him speaking in Germany. I saw him speaking. I thought he\u2019d be a good cheerleader for the country. He\u2019s been horrible. He\u2019s been divisive. He\u2019s been horrible. He hasn\u2019t even called Kate Steinle\u2019s family who got killed. He calls other people. But he hasn\u2019t called the family of Kate Steinle. Why wouldn\u2019t he call her? And this was a man that came over, was pushed over from Mexico. Five different \u2013 he shouldn\u2019t have been here. An illegal immigrant. And nobody\u2019s even called her family. Okay?

But they always want more, more. And in the end, they\u2019re not very happy people. So I don\u2019t know it\u2019s a great thing. Religion is a very big factor too.

Ross Perot cost us that election. Would you go on record today in saying that if you can\u2019t get the Republican nomination, you will not run as a third-party candidate? Look, I want this country \u2013 this country has great potential. But soon it\u2019s not going to have that potential because we\u2019re being drained by incompetent leaders, by horrible people. As an example, with the Iran deal, which is a total disaster, we didn\u2019t get our four hostages back. That\u2019s just one aspect of it. And just this morning and yesterday Secretary [John] Kerry, who\u2019s the worst \u2013 the worst negotiator. I mean, he didn\u2019t read the Art of the Deal, folks. So Secretary Kerry, he said very strongly \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to bring up the hostages. We didn\u2019t want to complicate our deal.\u201d \u2026We want our hostages back. How is that complicating a deal? Right? We gave them money. We didn\u2019t \u2013 so he didn\u2019t want to talk about the money. He didn\u2019t want to talk about the hostage. It was just announced that Iran got one of their leading nuclear scientists back as part of the deal. Just came out this morning. So Iran, in addition to making an unbelievable deal that\u2019s going to make them one of the great powers, perhaps more powerful than the United States because today it\u2019s about the weapons not about the number of soldiers you have. \u2026We\u2019re giving them billions and billions of dollars that we shouldn\u2019t be giving them. We didn\u2019t get our hostages back, which is terrible because they didn\u2019t want to complicate \u2013 we didn\u2019t want to complicate the negotiations. And when Obama was asked about that question the other day by Major \u2013 he was asked a very simple question \u2013 the anger in his face of being asked that question and he said \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to complicate.\u201d How is it complicated? Except for one problem. Iran just got their big scientist back and we just found out about it this morning. I think we are run by a group of incompetent people and they\u2019re destroying our country. And just one other thing, nobody deals with politicians more than I did. I\u2019ve contributed to everybody. They did whatever I said. Everybody. I contributed to Hillary Clinton. I contributed to Bill. I contributed to everybody. And you know what? I was a businessman. Why wouldn\u2019t I? I don\u2019t have to agree with them. I know this like with my wedding. I said, \u201cHillary, Bill, be at my wedding.\u201d They were at my wedding. That was very nice. Okay? Because I contribute. \u2026But as a businessman you have other things and you have other things to do. So I\u2019m very proud of a record. No politician in my opinion \u2013 I know them all, I watch them. They talk about the moon and the sun. The sun will rise and the moon will set. I watch them. People want jobs. No politician is going to get this country back. I\u2019m sort of a politician because I\u2019ve been dealing with politicians all my life. If you can\u2019t win and make a lot of money with politicians, you\u2019re not very good. Believe me. I\u2019ve been dealing with them all my life and I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s dealt with them any better. I know them. And I know it from the other side. All of the people, like when you see Bush has $100 million and you see Hillary has $50 million that they got, they just announced, those people are controlled by those people that gave them money. They\u2019re lobbyists. They\u2019re special interests. And they\u2019re donors. And I will tell you that they are totally controlled. And when Bush has to make a decision \u2013 and can you imagine this guy negotiating against China? We have no chance, okay? Who would you rather have negotiating against China? Trump or Bush? You tell me. Question: \nI was wondering how your faith and your family growing up has influenced how you raised your children?  And more than any other question, I get from people is \u201cHow did you raise your kids?\u201d Because you know you read so many horror stories about children. And one of them was through the church \u2013 very important. We have a church where I grew up \u2013 First Presbyterian Church in Queens \u2013 in Jamaica, Queens \u2013 and that\u2019s where I grew up and that\u2019s where I did went to church. I go to Sunday. I go to Bible class. I did all the things that a lot of the folks in this room did. Church was a very important element as far as growing the kids. And the other important element was I would from the time they\u2019re two-years-old say, \u201cNo drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes.\u201d And Ivanka, I remember, her looking at me once, \u201cDaddy, you\u2019re driving me crazy.\u201d The kid was like four-years-old. She didn\u2019t even know what drugs are. But I would constantly \u2013 because I\u2019ve seen so many children grow up and they get under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and their parents are brilliant people, they\u2019re successful people. The kid is brilliant. They have no chance. They have no chance. Once they\u2019re under the influence of the drugs and the alcohol, life is too tough, they\u2019re not going to make it. So I was very strong with my children, \u201cNo drugs, no alcohol\u201d, and I threw in cigarettes.

Bigger than anybody and everybody knows it. A beautiful day with incredible people that were wonderful, great Americans. I will tell you. John McCain goes, \u201cOh boy, Trump makes my life difficult. He had 15,000 crazies show up.\u201d Crazies \u2013 he called them all crazy. I said, \u201cThey weren\u2019t crazy.

So I said, nobody knows that \u2013 I said he graduated last or second to last \u2013 he graduated last in his class at Annapolis. And he was upset. I said, \u201cWhy?

It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought. I look at these roads being built all over the country and I say I can build those things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable. How bad. You know, we\u2019re building on Pennsylvania Avenue \u2013 the Old Post Office. We\u2019re converting it to one of the world\u2019s great hotels. It\u2019s going to be the best hotel in Washington D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after or one of them but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked Trump got it. Well, we got it for two reasons. Number one, we\u2019re really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I\u2019ll add in a third, we had a great financial statement because the General Services who are terrific people by the way and talented people they wanted to do a great job and they want to make sure it got built. So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it\u2019s like we\u2019re in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt\u2026You look at these airports. We are like a third world country. And I come in from China, and I come in from Qatar, and I come in from different places and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come back to this country and you have LAX disaster \u2013 you have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. Save Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it. Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse but save it. People have been paying in for years and now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States by making us rich again by taking back all of the money that\u2019s being lost. Renegotiate our foreign trade deals. Reduce our $18 trillion in debt because believe me we\u2019re in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that frankly has been good to me but I still hate to see what\u2019s happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated. Be careful of a bubble because what you\u2019ve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful. And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.

We have the opposite thinking. We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don\u2019t have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain. So I put together this statement and the only reason I\u2019m telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going. Because if we have another three or four years \u2013 you know, we\u2019re at $18 trillion now. We\u2019re soon going to be at $20 trillion. According to the economists who I\u2019m not big believers in but nevertheless this is what they\u2019re saying that $24 trillion \u2013 we\u2019re very close \u2013 that\u2019s the point of no return. $24 trillion.

We\u2019re going to be there very soon. So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie \u2013 Obamacare. I would build a great wall. And nobody builds walls better than me, believe me. And I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody. I will find within our military I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur. I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that\u2019s going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody \u2013 nobody \u2013 will be pushing us around. I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won\u2019t be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who\u2019s making a horrible and laughable deal, who\u2019s just being tapped along as they make weapons right now and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old and falls and breaks his leg. I won\u2019t be doing that, and I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you. I will immediately terminate President Obama\u2019s illegal executive order on immigration. Immediately. Fully support and back up the Second Amendment. Now it\u2019s very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity in a very, very hardcore prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers \u2013 two vicious people \u2013 escaped and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning and\u2026she said, \u201cYou know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn\u2019t want guns.

People that know me like me. Does my family like me? I think so. Right?  \u2026So the reporter said to me the other day, \u201cBut Mr. Trump, you\u2019re not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I said, \u201cI think that number one. I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I\u2019m actually a very nice person.\u201d But I said, \u201cThis is going to be an election that\u2019s based on competence because people are tired of these nice people and they\u2019re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.\u201d And they\u2019re tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita than any nation in the world and we\u2019re 26th in the world. 25 countries are better than us at education and some of them are like third world countries. But we\u2019re becoming a third world country because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads \u2013 everything. So one of the things I did, I said, \u201cYou know what I\u2019ll do? I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Because a lot of people said, \u201cHe\u2019ll never run. Number one, he won\u2019t want to give up his lifestyle.\u201d They\u2019re right about that but I\u2019m doing it. Number two, I\u2019m a private company. So nobody knows what I\u2019m worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth. So I said, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m proud of my net worth. I\u2019ve done an amazing job.\u201d I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens. And my father said \u2013 I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot. But he used to say, \u201cDonald, don\u2019t go into Manhattan. That\u2019s the big leagues. We don\u2019t know anything about that. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d I said, \u201cDad, I\u2019ve got to go to Manhattan. I got to build those big buildings. I\u2019ve got to do it, dad. I\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals. The Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the West Side. I did a lot of great deals and I did them early and young. And now I\u2019m building all over the world and I love what I\u2019m doing. But they all said \u2013 a lot of the pundits on television \u2013 \u201cWell, Donald will never run and one of the main reasons is he\u2019s private and he\u2019s probably not as successful as everybody thinks.\u201d So I said to myself, \u201cYou know, nobody\u2019s ever going to know unless I run.\u201d Because I\u2019m really proud of my success. I really am. I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical, that means education, that means everything. So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months because it\u2019s big and complex and they\u2019ve put together a statement \u2013 a financial statement. This is a summary but everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don\u2019t need extensions or anything. We\u2019ll be filing it right on time. We don\u2019t need anything. And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday because they said, \u201cHe had assets of $9 billion.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s the wrong number.\u201d That\u2019s the wrong number. Not assets. So they put together this and before I say it I have to say this: I made it the old fashioned way. It\u2019s real estate. You know, it\u2019s real estate. It\u2019s labor and it\u2019s unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren\u2019t in unions and it\u2019s all over the place and building all over the world. And I have assets \u2013 big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected \u2013 $9.24 billion. And I have liabilities of about $500 million. That\u2019s long-term debt, very low interest rates. In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, \u201cDonald, you don\u2019t have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t need it. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d And I\u2019ve been there. I don\u2019t want it. But in two seconds, they\u2019d give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth and now with the increase it will be well over $10 billion. But here a total net worth of $8 billion \u2013 net worth, not assets, not liabilities. A net worth after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets \u2013 Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street \u2013 sometimes referred to as the Trump Building\u2026many other places all over the world \u2013 so the total is $8.737 billion.

After I\u2019m called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I\u2019m called by all of the special interests and by the donors and by the lobbyists and they have zero chance of convincing me \u2013 zero, I\u2019ll get a call from the head of Ford.

We\u2019re not going to build it in Mexico.\u201d That\u2019s it. They have no choice. They have no choice. There are hundreds of things like that. I\u2019ll give you another example. Saudi Arabia. They make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many of them are in this building. They make $1 billion a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships, we say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to protect.\u201d What are we doing? They\u2019ve got nothing but money. If the right person asked them, they\u2019d pay a fortune. They wouldn\u2019t be there except for us. And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, \u201cYemen was a great victory.\u201d Two weeks later, the place was blown up and they kept our equipment. They always keep our equipment. We don\u2019t send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk because frankly it would be \u2013 we ought to send our surplus. We\u2019re always losing this gorgeous brand new stuff. But look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They\u2019re gone. And I\u2019m the one who made all the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I\u2019m running against now \u2013 it\u2019s so nice to say I\u2019m running as opposed to saying if I run, if I run. I\u2019m running. But all of these politicians I\u2019m running against now they\u2019re trying to disassociate \u2013 I mean you look at Bush. It took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn\u2019t answer the question. He didn\u2019t know. I said, \u201cIs he intelligent? Then I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question. Is Iraq a good thing or a bad thing? He didn\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t answer the question. How are these people going to lead us? How are we going to go back and make it great again? We can\u2019t. They don\u2019t have a clue. They can\u2019t lead us. They can\u2019t even answer simple questions. It was terrible. But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it. There are ships at sea \u2013 and this was during the worst crisis \u2013 that were loaded up with oil and the cartel kept the price up because again they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders. There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again and therefore make it great again because we need money. We\u2019re dying.

All of a sudden at the last moment, this big car manufacturer \u2013 foreign \u2013 announces they\u2019re not going to Tennessee; they\u2019re going to spend their billion dollars in Mexico instead. Not good. Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion. It\u2019s going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford \u2013 good company. So I announced that I\u2019m running for President. \u2026One of the early things I would do probably even before I got in \u2013 and I wouldn\u2019t even use \u2013 you know I have \u2013 I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones. You\u2019ve got a lot of them that are overrated. They\u2019re not good. They think they are. They get good stories because the newspapers get buffaloed. But they\u2019re not good. But I know the best negotiators in the world and I\u2019d put them one for each country. Believe me, folks, we will do very, very well. Very, very well. But I wouldn\u2019t even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know, if I was President, and say \u201cCongratulations. I understand that you\u2019re building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you\u2019re going to take your cars and sell them to the United States at zero tax, just flow them across the border.\u201d And you say to yourself, \u201cHow does that help us? Right? How does that help us? Where is that good?\u201d It\u2019s not. So I\u2019d say, \u201cCongratulations. That\u2019s the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we\u2019re going to charge you a 35% tax. Okay? And that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction and that\u2019s it.\u201d Now, here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. If it\u2019s not me in this position, it\u2019s one of these politicians that we\u2019re running against\u2026and here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, they\u2019re not so stupid. They know it\u2019s not a good thing. And they may even be upset by it. But then they\u2019re going to get a call from their donors or probably from the lobbyists for Ford and say, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to Ford because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can\u2019t do that to Ford.\u201d And guess what? No problem. They\u2019re going to build it in Mexico. They\u2019re going to take away thousands of jobs. It\u2019s very bad for us.

Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people. We have people that aren\u2019t working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they\u2019re going to have incentive to work because the greatest social program is a job. And they\u2019ll be proud and they\u2019ll love it and they\u2019ll make much more money than they would\u2019ve ever made. And they\u2019ll be doing so well and we\u2019re going to be thriving as a country \u2013 thriving. It can happen. I will be the greatest jobs President that God ever created. I\u2019ll tell you that. I\u2019ll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I\u2019ll bring back our jobs and I\u2019ll bring back our money. Right now, think of this. We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money and then they loan us back the money and  we pay them an interest. And then the dollar goes up so their deal\u2019s even better. How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they? \u2026I\u2019m going to tell you a couple of stories about trade because I\u2019m totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons. Number one, the people negotiating it don\u2019t have a clue. Our President doesn\u2019t have a clue. He\u2019s a bad negotiator. He\u2019s the one who did [Bowe] Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl. They get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there. We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That\u2019s the negotiator we have. Take a look at the deal he\u2019s making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won\u2019t exist very long. It\u2019s a disaster and we have to protect Israel. So we need people \u2013 I\u2019m a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don\u2019t have talented people, if you don\u2019t have great leadership, if you don\u2019t have people that know business not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs just about are gotten, free trade is terrible. Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people. But we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren\u2019t smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests and it\u2019s just not going to work. So here\u2019s a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And you know China comes over and they dump all their stuff and I buy it. I buy it because frankly I have an obligation to buy it. Because they devalued their currency so brilliantly. They just did it recently and nobody thought they could do it again. But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything \u2013 everything \u2013 they got away with it again. And it\u2019s impossible for our people here to compete. So I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. Calls me up a few weeks ago. He\u2019s very upset. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d He said, \u201cYou know, I make great product.\u201d And I said, \u201cI know. I know that because I buy the product.\u201d He said, \u201cI can\u2019t get it into China. They won\u2019t accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental. They talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.\u201d I said, \u201cWait a minute. That\u2019s terrible. Does anyone know this?\u201d He said, \u201cYeah, they do it all the time with other people.\u201d I said, \u201cThey send it back?\u201d He said, \u201cYeah. I finally go it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing that.\u201d I told him, \u201cNo, they do charge a tariff on trucks when we send trucks and other things over there. Ask Boeing. They wanted Boeing secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agree to buy planes from Boeing.\u201d Hey, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for \u2013 I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America building in 1290 Avenue of the Americas that I got from China is a war. Very valuable. I love China. Biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarter is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t like China.\u201d No, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders and we can\u2019t sustain ourselves with that. There\u2019s too much. It\u2019s like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That\u2019s the difference between China\u2019s leaders and our leaders. They are ripping us.

I\u2019ve dealt with them all my life. If you can\u2019t make a good deal with a politician, then there\u2019s something wrong with you. You\u2019re certainly not very good. And that\u2019s what we have representing us. They will never make America great again. They don\u2019t even have a chance. They\u2019re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests. Fully. They control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They\u2019re great. But you know what? It won\u2019t happen. It won\u2019t happen because we have to stop doing things for some people but for this country it\u2019s destroying our country. We have to stop and it has to stop now. Now, our country needs a truly great leader and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote The Art of the Deal. We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned. And we also need a cheerleader. You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, \u201cWell, the one thing I think he\u2019ll do well, I think he\u2019ll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he\u2019d be a great spirit. He was vibrant. He was young.\u201d I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader. He\u2019s not a leader. That\u2019s true. You\u2019re right about that. But he wasn\u2019t a cheerleader. He\u2019s actually a negative force. He\u2019s been a negative force. He wasn\u2019t a cheerleader. He was the opposite. We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It\u2019s not great again. We need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that. And I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They\u2019re saying, \u201cDad, you\u2019re going to do something that\u2019s going to be so tough.\u201d You know, all of my life I\u2019ve heard that a truly successful person \u2013 a really, really, really successful person \u2013 and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can\u2019t happen. And yet, that\u2019s the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again. So ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for President of the United States and we are going to make our country great again!

And I hear my fellow Republicans and they\u2019re wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don\u2019t know how to bring it about. They\u2019d come up to my office.

I have more accountants than I have nurses. It\u2019s a disaster. Patients are beside themselves.
